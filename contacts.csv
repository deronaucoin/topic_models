3653427,HM says that the placement was going great up until Easter. She says that they took AP to a special Easter gathering with her family at a very high end country club and discussed this event many weeks prior so that AP would dress appropriately. (they have had discussions about how AP dresses in the past) HM says that she offered to give her something to wear out of her closet to be sure that it was appropriate but AP didn't take her up on the offer. She says that AP put on a very tight and short dress. HM says that she very nicely told AP that it was not appropriate and she needed to change but AP got very upset and screamed at HM saying that is was a dress. She says that AP told HM that she was too conservative because she is Muslim and said that she was going to wait for the Christian's to get back to the house to go with them. HM says that this was very disrespectful and insulting. HM says that AP ended up changing into pants and a long sweater to go but didn't speak with HM and still is not speaking with her. HM says that the baby was crying this morning but AP did not get out of bed and HM was late for work because she had to wake AP up. HM says that HD is disgusted at the way that AP spoke with HM and says that AP only thinks that HM feels this way about how she dressed. HM says that HD is out of town and will return in the next 2 days. HM says that HD is very private and doesn't communicate with AP much and has HM communicate with AP. AD suggested that HD become more involved and begin to communicate with AP. HM says that she agrees and says that they will hold a meeting to discuss. HM says that HD says that he doesn't want AP to stay and they may want a rematch. HM will get back in touch with AD once the meeting happens.
3653418,Very well.  Amable fits in with their family.  She is also getting out and socializing.
3653405,"Called Brian and he said all si fine now, everything worked out and they are great, Sandy is great. She has had a bit of a hard time since her grandpa died and she is perhaps a bit too much with her boyfriend. Brien would like her to not be stuck with this boyfriend all the time, but for her to go out with friends more.. Ad is encouraging her to do so.."
3653396,she said they are doing well and Fedi is learning to come to a good understanding that all families have to work out issues and you can just run away from it. She is doing well with the kids and eats dinner with the family.

AP is still working on her driving skills but HM is not ready for the AP to drive alone.  HM explained that she has risen with the AP and told the AP she would not give her directions to the school since the AP has risen with the HM to the school for several weeks now.  HM said that the AP gets confused and doesn't know how to get there without help from the HM.  HM did say that the AP is great with the younger children and is a self started and helps out a lot around the house.

3653211,HD says they are all doing well.  HD says AP will be part of interview process for new AP.  HD feels confident about the process to find someone new but says it's hard to find the hours to dedicate to it.  I offered my assistance and Ginny's.
3653209,HF says things are going well.  AP joined a few other APs for a trip recently to Annapolis and DC to the Navy Ball.  HM thinks AP will be at meeting this weekend.
3653202,going very well. AP Itziar did return home to see her dad and she returned so much happier.HF was very supportive of her going. IF he passes this summer they would make room in schedule for her to go back.
3653196,HM says all is going well..  AP is still a bit of a home body but they enjoy her company.
3653194,Very well. HM adores AP and they are truly sad to see her go.  I talked to HM about the process of getting a new AP.
3653178,her parents were visiting and just left on Sat. They gave her some time off and cut her loose on other days so she could do things with them. HF asked if she wanted to extend with them and she was going to try to work it out for a 6 month extend but not sure.
3653174,"Not well, AP is homesick and feels the baby is too fragile for her to take care of"
3653167,"Everything is going really well.  HF all moved and unpacked and settled in.  Jessi has been a big help and is really settled as part of the family.  Has good friends, started school 2 weeks ago, hm feels everything has transitioned really well."
3653162,"HM was waiting for conference call and will call back. Everything OK, status quo."
3653150,"HM called AD back and said that they are happy with AP, and she is doing well.  AP takes class Saturday morning.  AP also has found a good balance and found friends, both APs and through church.  They are dreading having to find, train a new AP next year."
3653129,HM returned my call. She says things are good.  She is very happy that AP decided to extend with them after all.  They are giving her 2 weeks off in May to go home to see her family.  Went over ext. app process with HM.
3653128,OK- still has not decided about extending.
3653124,HF and AP are doing well since AD discussed some concerns last month. HF is in Disney and AP has some vacation days as well.
3653098,"HF is super excited AP is going to extend, they are so happy!  AP is so close to her mom hf really didn't think she would.  They are going to help her go home for a visit and get her second year visa and we discussed the timing of all of that."
3653097,Ad spoke to HM that is a little upset about AP having a boyfriend . HM asked what rules were  set up in regards to dating by the AP's. AD explained that APC does not have rules in regards to dating. HM should create her own house rules in regards to male guests and dating
3653092,"Fine, a few minor things, but nothing the HF can't work through compared to past experiences. HM mentioned hat AP doesn't let her know when the baby's cereal is gone, she just puts the empty box back into the cabinet. The baby's medicine had spilled in the cabinet and instead of cleaning it up, AP continued to place things inside/take out from sticky cabinet. AP took a 3 hour driving course and received a ""D"" from the instructor. The instructor told the HM that the AP would need considerable practice in every aspect of driving. He could not believe that the AP had ever driven before. Instructor told HM that AP does not use her blind spot and almost hit another car while practicing. HM mentioned that while practicing parallel parking the heard a loud screech and witnessed the AP almost hit a neighbor's car. AP told the HF that her sandal got stuck under the gas pedal. HF is reconsidering the possibility of extending with this AP due to the fact that they will be moving further out and AP will really need to be able to drive. HM also said that since the baby is getting older the HM wants to AP to take the HC to activities starting to socialize the HC more and more. HM has offered to show AP how to take the bus to a local park./splash pad using the stroller and AP said she is too afraid. HM also has offered to take the AP to meet up with other friends, but AP prefers to sit in her room on her days off. HF is concerned that with moving further out AP will be more isolated than ever. I mentioned to the HM that there are several FB pages for AP's to meet up in the greater Phoenix area and including our own cluster's FB page that the AP can put a message out to plan something. Again, HM said she has offered to take AP. HM is wondering if she could have access to possible available AP's to see what their choices may be. I also said the HF should look into using our ME's since they could be very helpful."
3653085,Ad spoke to the HM on the phone for 30 minutes.  The HM has a new job and is working from home.  The HM is now 5 1/2 months pregnant.  The HM started the HC in preschool and pulled him out of Crème de le Crème.  The HM is now trying Bright Horizons which has a better student/teacher ratio.  The HM is very happy with her AP and the entire family is traveling to Puerto Rico next week for some relaxation time.
3653081,"Everything is going really well, Anna rode her bike up Lookout Mtn, so that was a big accomplishment.  HF keeping in touch Angelika and looking forward to having her come.  HF had a lot of company the past 2 weeks, but everyone is home now so all is getting back to normal."
3653071,Spoke with HD. They are considering extending with Maricarmenr for 12 months. I told him that I am happy to hear and will send him an email with info.
3653066,Great. We are so sad that she has decided not to extend.
3653065,Everything is great.  They love July.  They plan to spend a lot of time this summer at their cottage in MI.  July will go with them.
3653055,Everything is wonderful. The HF had family over for Easter and the AP was a big help with the kids.
3653043,Ainara is doing well. The girls really like her and she seems very engaged and happy with them
3653032,HM says things with AP are good.  No problems. Since AP did not pass her first attempt at the driver's test they are looking into going to a different testing center where they can maybe get a Spanish speaking instructor.
3653031,"Everything is going good.  They had a great vacation, got to meet Emilie's parents which was a lot of fun.  HM had a wonderful time in Italy, gained 10 pounds from the wonderful food.  They've talked about extending, Emilie is considering 6 months which hf would be thrilled with.  HM asked when they should be in selections if she doesn't, and I advised August."
3653027,Thiings are going well. Her parents were just here for a visit and they had fun
3653026,"AD spoke to HM and she says things are going very well with their AP and they will be sad when she leaves.   HM says that the Jewish community has been celebrating passover and a week long of festivities which ended today. HM says that she is an observer but not a strict observer. HM went to work today.  ***HM says that the next holiday is called:  Shavuot which starts on June 3rd sunset--(June 4 - 5, 2014).   FYI: The Day the Torah was given -- celebrating the monumental encounter between God and the Israelites at Mount Sinai, an event which changed mankind forever."
3653024,Very well.  AP will travel to Germany for two weeks in May and plans on extending.
3653012,"Mona apologized for not calling me back sooner, as she is traveling in Shanghai right now but called to say that everything is great with Anne So.  She doesn't think they will get an new AP."
3652992,"Kyah said everything is great.  She said they had a great time in Vegas and Yui was really helpful.  She said Yui's boyfriend came to stay with them in Vegas and they would sightsee every day for 6 hours in the morning when they didn't need anyone to help with Haven.  They're also going to NYC for 5 days, San Diego for the 4th of July and Spokane in June."
3652991,HM says things are good.  No issues.  No questions.
3652986,"Spoke with Eloiza and everything is going great with AP.  Her husband has bee busy at work, but things are slowing down so they can start looking for new AP's for an arrival date of 8/7."
3652974,HM called. Things are okay.  AP was supposed to go on vacation with them to GA last week during spring break but AP decided not to go at the last minute.  HM felt that AP changed her mind because they talked to her about an incident where she rode their daughter home from the bus stop on HD's bike and left the two boys to essentially walk home by themselves and then AP left the bike outside over night.
3652972,"Everything is going just fine, her knee is better.  HM knows she needs to get her going in school.  Hm has been in contact with someone who is starting a new class for aupairs and she tried to forward me the email yesterday but it bounced back.  She'll send it again."

3652928,Holly said things are great.
3652908,"AP is doing great. She is bonding better with the kids. HF referred a lead, Amy Patton as a potential HF."
3652895,Monica said overall everything is fine.  She said she rates Olga an 8.5 on a scale of 1-10 but still has complaints about how self serving Olga can be.  She is bothered by how Olga never will do anything until asked.  She also doesn't like how Olga just leaves and doesn't ask or say anything especially last weekend when the car Olga uses has a flat tire and she just took off and didn't worry about helping Daniel get it to the mechanic.   I told Monica since their new au pair is Olga's friend it will be very important to set up expectations with the new au pair and avoid what has bothered her about the placement with Olga.  I told her I wanted her to have a better experience next time even if its not with APC and she replied she might be back to APC the next time around.
3652887,"Mediation was conducted on 4/22 with Sandy, Jeannine, Mirna, Steve, Natalie and Spanish translator(another AP). See notes below:"

She did hit a dumpster while she was practicing for the test.  HF are ok with it, AP will pay the $250 and she is so beat up about it, hf had to reassure her all was ok and it was a lesson learned."
3652827,"Lisa says that all is going good. She says that Angie is doing great. Lisa states that she will be out of the country, starting tomorrow, traveling for 12 days, but that her husband will be staying home with Angie. They are wishing to extend with Angie, and she agrees to this! Lisa requested information emailed to her on the process. AD will do so."
3652819,"HM says all is well no problems at all. HF isn't sure if they should get an other ap or not, bc 2 daughters are no older and don't need as much supervision."
3652815,Jill continues to do well and appreciate all Natilia is doing for their family. She does not have any questions or concerns at this time.

3652771,"Ariane called me back.  She said things are still the same. The host parents have been really busy with work, so they have not sat down with Carmen and talked about making sure she is more focused on the details of the job, like remembering things needed to be done for the girls, chores, keeping discipline with Iphones, etc.   She said that this is in her court and will talk with Carmen, but it will turn into a problem for them if this doesn't change.    Ariane said that she will keep me in the loop."
3652756,4/5/2014 I spoe with the HF James and he was concerned regarding the refund and when he would see the refund credited back into his account. I let him know I would find out and get back to him. He stated he called the home office and they directed him back to me regarding the refund.

I let her know that I just talked to Damla yesterday and sent Damla the NREZ 1040 sheet and other information regarding filing her tax return.
3652727,"HM was feeling frustrated because AP is not pulling his weight. He is very nice, but he is not on top of things and seems to be more focused on socializing than being an AP. She wants to make it work but needed some advice. I advised her to have a big sit down meeting with a written list of things that need to change for the match to continue to work. Focus on the positives and what he can do to make things better. She was going to sit down with him when she got back from her business trip."

3652550,"All is going well with Paula.  She is more reserved as an au pair and that is great, as it means low maintenance overall.  She has some friends, but does not like to party and family is very happy about that and with her overall."
3652542,"AD spoke with HM, things are going well, HF decided to get a third car, HM and AD spoke about the limitations. HM is happy with how things worked out with AP, but says next time she will do things a little differently. HM says AP corrects her with her own children, and she has allowed it and even looked to her for advise, but says the role reversal is damaging."

3652527,"Amy and the family are well.  They had two great vacations this month and Delphine joined them for both--Miami and Michigan.  ""Best au pair ever""!  Amy wishes that Aaron could retire, because work seems to be interfering with their family like, but they will stay the road at this time.  Amy will be taking 6 weeks off this summer so she is preparing for that. Delphine's boyfriend, Emanuel, is visiting this weekend and they are all going out to dinner on Friday."
3652501,"The match has been great overall.  HM shared how recently there have been some scheduling issues.  There are times that the HM will change the schedule and the AP is requesting enough time to know  (1 or 2 wks) so, she can schedule her free time.  HM shared she is not always able to do that.  AD recommended that the HM sit and talk to the AP and see if there could be a good resolution that everyone can be happy with.  HM admitted that they haven't sat down to ck in for many months.  HM stated they will sit and chat and try to work it out so everyone is happy. HM will let me know how the conversation goes and ask AD for assistance if necessary."

3652446,AD spoke to HD and he says that things are going really well. HD says that their only concern is that their AP has not selected any classes to fulfill the educ requirement. AD explained that she has been working with the AP to find classes of interest.
3652441,"Placement is going great.  Family has been traveling a lot.  Updated on their move to the DC area, Bill said they would not be moving before June and would let me know when they find a home."
3652433,very good. Very happy with AP. Hoping AP will extend with HF.
3652429,"AD spoke to HM and she says that they just love their AP and things are going well. AD explained to HM that the AP is not able to work from her home and the ex-husband's home.

HF is in selection but they also checking with different agency. I shared with HM that her AP never replies to my calls usually I have to call her 5-6 times each month."
3652408,"Things are going well-- AP is very shy and is not a driver, so her social life is a bit limited.  She is homesick.  HM is very proactive with AP-- offering to drive her to places and encouraging her to make friends."
3652406,Spoke with HM and everything is good. AP's family is visiting and have been busy with Easter. HF will be moving back to Australia and will be leaving the program when Ap's placement is finished.

3652390,"Things are slowly improving.  Very long phone call discussing whether to rematch-- she is going to keep AP, but I will talk to AP about making an effort with her relationship with HM and other adults-  The gist of the problem is not the 45 hours of work-- that is good-- it is that the AP chooses to spend no time with the family outside of those hours and does not join family on any holiday activities or while they are at the beach-- only wants to spend the minimum time required with the family and no more.  HM is frustrated and hurt by this (former AP is now like a daughter and she sought that kind of warm, member of the family)."

3652385,"HM feeling well.  Baby coming in October. Have talked to AP a little about extending, but AP does not have U2. HM will ask her if she has the requisite U2 experience to remain in the house. Otherwise, talked about deadlines and getting back in selection."

3652314,"AD spoke to HM and she is having her baby next Tuesday (C-section).   HM says that there was an emergency scare yesterday; HM was notified by the AP that her daughter had fallen and cut her head.

3652274,"Very well.  Current AP is getting ""sad"" that her program year ends in May."
3652268,Very well. AP has become part of the family and there is a good chemistry. Kids listen to her. HF wants her to meet more non Spanish speaking people so she can practice her English. AP goes to city in weekends and has friends.
3652259,"HF is on spring break, so taking HC on vacation soon.  AD discussed that 2nd year with AP can still have challenges and that HM should call AD to discuss any challenges just as she did the first year."

3651928,"Spoke at length with Erle last week. He said that things continue to be difficult with Lina. He said that she continues to ask for things (like time off) even after he has indicated that she is to work. He said that he feels she does not know how to deal with people or communicate. I aked how she was doing with the children as Lina indicated that things are great with them. Erle said that the kids feel that she controls them and they don't really like her. He said that the kids have told her that she goes to the bathroom to talk with her boyfriend while she is watching the kids. He said that a week ago Lina texted that her cousin was spending the night. He said that she did not ask, but rather told him even though the rules indicate that she is to ask."

3651883,"AP is okay. She is not ideal, but they are making it work. She only eats with HF 1 or 2 times a week and HM wishes it was more. She is good with the kids, but Isla clearly has some issues with her as she told her she wanted her to go back to France so they could have an AP who spoke better English. She is on her third boyfriend, this one lives in North Bend. She sucks her thumb and HM believes AP was a smoker before coming here. HM had questions about their next search. We talked about options with timing and I strong recommended that they do not have an overlap. Informed her of early match discount"
3651859,"Everything is great with AP. THey will have her mother in law stay with the kids during their lapse in care, but are happy to start their next match in the summer so that they have a better pool of APs in the future. HM tore her ACL and AP has been amazingly helpful. HF lived in Belgium for 6 years so they are excited for their new AP."

HMs school schedule will be getting hectic in the next two months. HM plans on going over the schedule in detail with the AP.
3651794,"Everything is going great, HF loves their AP and thinks she is fabulous. It was a bit of a slow start but they have found a great groove and hosting an AP has been what they hoped for in terms of childcare and cultural exchange. HF is hoping AP will consider extending for a second year with them. AD will send information on extending with current AP and repeat family discount information if AP does not extend."
3651790,"Good, spoke to Lynell. Everything is going well. She said she is not repeating program and planning to put the kids in preschool"

HM welcomed AP's natural parents for dinner last weekend, and she said it was great to meet them."
3651697,"""It is what it is"". HM continues to be very frustrated with the spaciness of the AP.

She glided through a stop sign twice. Matt also reported that she can not change lanes. Matt and Sheila are too afraid to allow Mel to drive their children. They do not want Mel to stay. Mel is great with the kids but they need a driver. I will go out tomorrow to do a mediation.
3651637,HM had some questions about current AP leaving early.  HF is looking at home and has made an offer in Richmond.  New home will be much too small to accommodate an AP and HM is now planning to stay home from work.  No set moving date yet.

3651608,I reached out to HF asking if they would be willing to speak with HF Thompson about AP. Things are going well with AP.
3651607,"Things are going just okay. They are not at the point where they would want to rematch, they are just at the point that they have accepted things are not as good as they were with Chris. We discussed ways of helping the AP follow directions better including writing things down and have the AP go through the task to demonstrate that she understands, and she may not be communicated that she is confused. She is good with the kids and has a clear bond with them."
3651596,"Spoke with Ginny. She said that things are not great with Gabriela. She does what she is supposed to do and does her job, but is not caring with the kids and does not interact with the family. They have invited her to dinner since she arrived and have stopped asking. they invited her to Easter dinner and she said she had already eaten. The kids were sick and she took their temperatures but never asked the kids how they felt or showed any concern with them. Camila does what she is told/asked but has no connection to the family and is not warm and fuzzy. She has shown no interest I them. Ginny said that the kids have loved and bonded with everyone of their other aps. SHe said that she thinks they will see the match through, but doesn't want to take Gabriela on vacation with them. They have taken their other aps on vacation but Ginny does not feel comfortable taking Gabriela. She asked if they have to take her. Advised that they are not obligated to take Gabriela on vacation with them."
3651593,Things are moving along.  AP is learning the routine and getting used to everything.  No real big issues at this point in time.  HM is just teaching AP little by little.
3651592,HF is doing very well and Andy is great.  HF is relocating to Sweden so they will no longer need their au pair as of July.  Their plan is to be gone for 3 years.
3651578,HM says that they are great! Family is in New York visiting and Juli is on vacation this week. Things with Juli are wonderful still and they are very happy.
3651576,Everything is going well. HM had some questions about process of visa renewal in Colombia. She is going to have Maria check with her agency in Colombia.
3651563,HM is very pleased with how everything's going.  AD let her know that the AP has booked her return flight home last week to plan early for her friend's visit at the end of the program year and shared how that made her feel sad to prepare to say goodbye.  HM shared the same feeling.  AP will be deeply missed.  HM confirmed that they will not be continuing with the program after Aug.

Amber said that Natalia seemed upset earlier and didn't come home right away after the AP event. I shared with Amber the reasons that Natalia shared with me for her unhappiness (limited driving privleges,limited access to ESL classes, boredom). We talked about the fact that Natalia does not yet have her MN DL and that is the main reason that they restrict her driving to a small perimeter around their home. Natalia failed the written test once and has shown no motivation to try and take the test again, despite Natalia telling me that she has been denied the opportunity because the HF won't take her to the test. Amber reports they have offered several times to take her. Regarding the ESL classes, Natalia wants to take a class that is three nights a week at the community education center (the class does not count for her VIsa requirements) and says that she can only get there one night a week because of her work schedule.  Amber states that the work schedule does not prevent her from getting to the class except on the rare occasion and that Natalia has not seemed motivated to go.  Amber wants to talk with Natalia after work on Friday because until just a few days ago, everything seemed great.  I let her know I would check in with Natalia again to determine her current state of mind.  They really want Natalia to stay."

HM was able to diffuse the situation over the phone but is concerned.

Robin had to remind her that she is here t be an au pair, yet this doesn't matter to Itana. HF sponsored her & will notify the DOS that they are no longer going to do this, because Itana has decided to leave them.  They had a business plan on the calender for three months and would be the first weekend Itana was to work in many months. Itana told them she would not do this so they had to fly Bob's sister in to care for the children at the last minute. She has no interest in the children and the boys are so frustrated with her, she is disrespectful to them Itana left the house to get the boys with an hour to spare,yet showed up 45 mins. late, leaving them waiting at the bus,after a very long day at school.

3650035,Very Well.  Isa is doing a good job.  She is cleaning up and taking good care of Leighton.
3650026,"Well.  She is very focused on her next au pair now.  She has started preparing the kids, which she thinks may have hurt Emi's feelings, so she is trying to make that better.  Things are pretty seemless now, even when she travels every other week or so, her family comes in and/or Mark and everyone knows who has to be there at what time.  She was disappointed in new au pair applicant Maki's lack of interest and not doing what she was told, to call Hiromi and Emi.  We discussed it and decided she should go with her gut.  She has done a good job so far choosing au pairs and if she is that frustrated before she even arrives, then it probably isn't the right fit.  I saw the new AP Ayfer put in her Family Room Asuka and thought she was good, so I told Alyssa several good points about her application, 25, good exp. driving/7 years, some college completed, she likes to cook, worked at the red cross society for orphans.  I told her that I looked at her video too and while the music is a little loud, I found myself smiling at her, and it was nice that she made such a good video to show herself.  She seems very nice.  She agreed and said she would interview her right away.  Alyssa said Emi's trip is putting her in a bit of a bind and she is aware that she could have trouble coming home, which will really be a problem.  She didn't know what to do as if her grandmother died and she didn't let her go, she would feel terrible.  It's an important time at work though to prove herself.  Alyssa also helped by speaking to lead Tina Allaire, who asked her all about everything, including what she does for a living, about her kids, etc."
3650024,"Things are going okay. HM mentioned AP seemed a bit down this week because she is anxious about returning home. AP has loved her time in the US and isn't sure what she is going to do when she returns home to Japan. HM said AP has also been stressed about her current class and taxes. HM also said AP is frustrated because the children don't want to eat what she is cooking. HM noted AP is the best cook they have had and told the AP it was the children exerting power, not about her food and cooking. HM said they had another conversation and things seem to be better."
3649987,"Good.  Cintia is doing well, the boys love her.   Annie informed me of their purchase of a new home in Minneapolis.  I told her about switching to Julie as her Area Director.  I will still keep Cintia up to date on all we do with our cluster meetings."

She broke up with her boyfriend and things seemed better but now has friends who stay out very late. They don't mind that she is out late, but just want to know that she is safe. Brielle feels like they don't always communicate well. They have asked her to text them by 5am if she is coming home and that she is ok. She was reluctant to do this. Suggested they talk about it from a parent standpoint. She said that the kids really love her and that is the most important thing.  I asked how her interviews were going. She said that they felt a lot of pressure to match by may for the early bird special but haven't found anyone great. They are going to begin their search again in a couple of weeks. They are most interested in finding someone who is social, easy going and over 21. HM does not want to deal with someone underage."
3649935,Good family have found a new match that worked well with Karol's departure. Host mom said that her parents will be leaving in the following weeks but that things are going well

3649127,All is great AP has her TXDL and SS card and is looking into more courswork at Richland College Everyone is getting along great
3649057,"HM said that everything is going well with AP Vivien and their family. I thanked HM for referring her friend Kate Sanderson to me. Their children attend the British School as well. I told HM Laurie about the 6/14/14 US Cup AP/HF event at the Dank Haus, but HM said that her children will still be in school at that time and AP Vivien will be on vacation then."
3649011,"HD Kosti said that AP Cami is ""incredible"" and has ""really come into her own since the baby came"".  They will miss her horribly, and are getting ready for looking for the next AP.  Thanked him for referral (noted check referral).  Asked HD to have AP call me for monthly call."
3649002,Great.  HF very happy w/ AP.  AP a little frustrated with class at Fairfield as it is difficult to keep up with the language.  AP making friends.  HM noticed the Muthersbaughs have a new AP as Rohan went to Montessori with one of the girls. HF hopes AP extends when her PY is up. HM happy to hear another French AP coming to Fairfield in July.
3648993,AP and HF have had a good month.  AP's arm which he cut while in SF is healing well.  HM does not know if AP has gotten hospital bills from the accident.  AP and HM check in each day to see how kids have behaved.  HM says AP and boy have a good relationship
3648988,"Spoke with Amy. She said that things are going great with Carol and the boys. She said that Carol received 2 very large bills from Bryn Mawr hospital and Main Line Emergency. Amy said that in February Carol had a very bad sore throat. Amy took her to the minute clinic and called UHC. Carol did not have her insurance card, but UHC was aware of this. The minute clinic sent Carol to Bryn Mawr ER b/c her throat was so swollen. Amy called UHC and let them know that Carol was going to the ER. Carol was treated in the ER and then released after several hours. She received IVs and antibiotics while in the ER. Advised that Carol will need to appoint a PRA and suggested that it be Amy. They will complete the form and call UHC. I asked Amy to follow up with me. Amy's Grandmother passed away last week and they are all very sad. Amelia is coming for a visit in the summer. Amy has someone in Italy whom she would like to match with. This would be a pre-match. Amy has spoken with Laura and thinks she has begun the process."
3648979,"AD spoke at length with HM.  Things are going well with Liesel, and nobody seems to be able to believe that this is the end of the road with au pairs!  HC Lizzy is asking about having an exchange student so she wont be so lonely with AP gone and her brother gone."
3648966,"HM told me that all is well. Her daughter is in spring break, but not her son, so Daria has a different schedule this week."
3648961,"HM told me that all is great with Kaori. She has a friend that is interested in getting an au pair and she told him to go on our website. I told HM to send me his contact info, so I can contact him and give him a promo code and make sure HM will get the referral bonus, if they match."
3648950,Spoke with Marc and all is well with Antonina. Little things they work on daily with Antonina.  She is in Vegas with friends from Germany.  He is concerned how the kids will deal with it when AP leaves and asked if there are any tips for getting kids through it.  HF mentioned that both kids will be going into daycare in the Fall so they won't need an AP any longer.
3648943,will update
3648939,will update
3648936,Good
3648928,"AD spoke with HM and HM said that her AP is doing great despite the drama that began a couple of weeks ago when her current AP took her natural parents to Atlanta to fly back home to Costa Rica along with 6 other AP's including the HF's former AP.  HM explained that the other AP's turned their back on her current AP and then began venting to the AP's natural parents about her and HM explains that it got really ugly from there.  HM said that she is supporting her current AP's decisions and is very disappointed in the way the other AP's behaved.  HF has plans to travel to Dallas, TX tomorrow for the long holiday weekend.  HM is very excited about the trip and says she, CJ and AP may get baptized while they are there at the HM's favorite church."
3648905,Spoke with Mary Ann and she said Claire is doing great!  No questions or concerns.
3648897,AD spoke with HM and HM said that things with her AP are getting better and that the first 3 to 4 months are always a time to get to know each other.  AP is doing a great job with the children and HM continues to get to know her AP better.
3648895,"going well, just returned for OS trip will call back with details."
3648890,"Melissa said that Krystina has above all, the BEST work ethic out of all their AP's!! They give her one morning off a week so she doesn't have responsibilities with the kids before school and she came down to make tea for herself at 6:00 AM and while the h2o was heating she went a head and got breakfast stuff out and made lunches! HF says she has the greatest attitude!!! The issue with the homework that came up has been solved by Phillippe and her doing more of the homework with the kids. AP has so many strong things about her so that is her weakness and they will compensate. They still want to work on stronger communication about it but all is good."
3648887,gong well. they asked again about getting info to sponsor her to stay with them a 3rd year and pursue her education. Gave them contact info for HF w/ May so they could see what they need to do legally.
3648886,"AD spoke with HD Rob, who sounded very busy with work.  He stated that things were going well with Mih, and that they were all adjusting well.  We talked a little about upcoming vacation time and DOS guidelines.  They would decide how to proceed (bring Mih or pay her to stay home)."
3648873,HF and AP had a nice vacation in PR but HM had to have appendix taken out when they came back. AP is doing well.
3648865,HM told me that all is well with Emeline. They are getting to know each other and so far all is great

3648848,spring break for the younger kids is next week so they will go to Leggoland and the beach and parks etc.
3648839,"Briefly spoke with HM between patients.  She states that things are ""fine"" with match, and seems pleased with Gisele (AP).  Confirmed that match is 100% compliant.  AP has SS# and bank account squared away, now, and they are all going away for Easter."
3648820,"AD and HM Ambre spoke at length.  Things are going very well with match, and Martina is doing an outstanding job.  HF has additional behavioral modification for HC Carson, and also he has responded very well to Martina.  Martina is still very much a ""homebody"" which is fine with HF because they genuinely enjoy her and consider her a part of the family.  They are already thinking about extension, but will not say anything to Martina, yet, because they are afraid of overwhelming her."
3648813,"HM is going to Seattle again. AP is doing ok, has a couple friends are leaving and that's tough on AP."
3648810,"Good. AP has decided not to extend, so HM is concentrating on getting new AP. HM states she is thinking of moving to CA and wanted to know about process of moving with APC. AD explained."
3648793,"Spoke with Carla. She is doing great and she really loves Brenda. She and Brenda are doing Crossfit together in RWC. She is going to pay for Brenda's membership because it is motivation for her to get to the gym.  Brenda reached out to the new Brazilian Au Pair coming in in April, around the corner from her. I also let Carla know about the new Colombian AP who just came into Palo Alto."
3648791,"HF let me know AP just received info that her Grandmother OS in Hospice w/ Leukemia. AP is saying she doesn't want to end her program year early but not sure what to do.

3648775,"HM says all is going really well, AP is a big help she even is looking at the AP's for the HF next year."
3648774,Julie and I talked about Soso's rash. she was happy I helped Soso find a dermatologist.  The rash is not serious and should clear with meds.
3648771,HF and AP have had a good month.  Hm spoke with AP about being careful giving personal information to strangers and both HM and AP agreed they need to be more open if anything is bothering the person.  HM said since the conversation the relationship and communication has improved.  Ap has several friends and had Shiori send the night last weekend
3648765,I spoke with Emily. She apologized for not calling me back earlier. She has been crazy busy with the new baby.   All going great with Pauline.  Pauline is in NY right now with friends.
3648754,"Well- Christina just returned from a 10 day audit trip in London, had started to interview Danish APs before she left, and will continue nolw that she is back- will try to get matched and receive the early match discount. AD let her know that the danish pool has 23 APs in it, many with transcripts.  Christina is very happy with Anne."
3648746,"AP is wonderful ad HM is very pleased.  Hm does not have the same relationship with this AP as the previous AP.  AD reminded HM every AP is different and HM admits that AP is excellent with boys.  AD recommends that HM find time once a week to sit with AP and ""check in"".  HM admits she has not been having weekly meetings and really has not had much chance to get to know AP.  Hm will follow through with weekly time with AP."
3648745,"It is like night and day, says Kat- Kevin agrees. They are thrilled with Andy's energy compared to how secretive and dramatic Celine was.  Her english is not strong, the AO needed to be translated by Yina, the former AP who is married and lives a few blocks away.  AD not sure how much Andy is taking in, as it is a hectic household and she appears to be a little shell shocked, but happy.  Her project was beautifully done and included recipes."
3648740,"AD got HM on the phone as she was trying to piece together her family's summer schedule.  She said that all was well with the match, and that Luana is ""wonderful, as always"".  Denise also expressed happiness because AP's mother in Brazil will be coming to visit in October.  Match 100% compliant"
3648732,"This year can't end soon enough, says Tina.  Mandy has taken a great deal of vacation and booked her return flight on her final day 5/6 through APC without consulting them.  Now wants extra days of vacation and Tina is thoroughly tired of her attitude. AD expressed the importance of the monthly contacts and Tina promises to return calls more promptly. Looking forward to Felly's arrival."
3648712,"HM Krista stated that things are ""great with Mari.  She and Isabela are in regular contact to help the transition go smoothly, and we all Skypre regularly too.  We will miss Mari, but she is doing a wonderful job of helping things go well when she leaves.""  Match 100% compliant."
3648709,"Well.  Nico plans to EXT for 6 months, which is good for them.  They are unsure if they will get another AP after her as the kids are getting older now and would like the extra bedroom since they have to share (4 bedroom house.)  We discussed how older kids are still not much easier than younger since they have mroe going on, and Haley pointed out that it is better for their resume's to have more activities so she doesn't want to hold them back.  She will see how busy she is in January and then decide, or maybe try to swing it without for a while and get another before summer if it isn't going well.  Nico is good though and she is glad she is extending.  Things are easy now."
3648708,"All is going well and she is driving more and so all that is good. Even though they have not talked about extending, they would prefer to have a different AP, mainly due to Busi not being a totally experienced diver. they also want someone who can be more active with Henry. We spoke about interviewing with other APs and what to look for and to use skype etc. She was interested in ICAP Ximnea and wondering why Ximnea is not extending with her current HF"
3648707,HM says all is going really well. AP came back from Australia where she attended a wedding and was tired for some days. HM says that usually after 2 mt there is something annoying that the AP does but not with this one. All is working really well.
3648697,"Ronni emailed last night and so I called her today and we chatted about her difficulties.  She said while Vilde is sometimes wonderful and the boys love her, she and Adam are sick of her not pitching in around the house much.  She will empty the dishwasher in the morning, but she leaves open the cabinets, forgets to push in her chair, doesn't take out the recycling or only takes her items, leaves boxes and bags in her room, doesn't make her bed, doesn't refill the Brita water containers that she also uses, and won't clean dishes in the sink if they aren't hers, while other people have had to clean her dishes.  HM doesn't like this mentality and would like for her to teach the boys better habits.  Hm feels like she has mentioned this before, so I will speak to Vilde about it.  I tried to call, but didn't reach her and she doesn't have VM."
3648687,Well- Melissa cut her finger and may need stitches- will see a Dr. AD re-sent Insurance info to HM and AP.
3648679,"HM Jane was standing beside Dany when AD called, so it was a pleasure to get to speak with Jane as well!  Jane said that she and Dany are a ""great team"" and that things are ""going beautifully"".  They were in Ocean City together, and doing some shopping to get HC David ready for camp.  They are excited about year #2, and match is 100% compliant."
3648663,"HM says all is well and on cruise control. HM worries for AP since she is so close to the boys what she will do once she goes home,HM knows that she shouldn't worry so early on."
3648654,"Spoke with Cynthia. She said that things were going well with Bruna and Athena. She still feels that she lacks confidence and isn't sharp, but things are ok."
3648606,HD said it has been a great experience to have AP Marina with them. HF wouldn't have known what to do without her and HD hopes that it was good for her as well.
3648597,Mike called me back. Got good schedule in place and kids taken well care of. HD leaving town for job on May 12.
3648581,Nice chat with Monica. Talked about her au pair search and working with Jeff. Ali still been great although looking forward to next chapter of her life now. Alex is recovering well from his surgery.
3648529,All is well
3648525,"Things are going well with incoming AP Jenny. HD,AP and AD had an extensive AP orientation with incoming AP last evening. HD was happy with AP Sonia and there have been no issues."
3648507,HM is very excited to have Chris stay with them for another year. They haven't received the DS2019 form yet and I told HM that it was mailed to ap on 4/10. HM will check and get back to me.
3648504,"Very well, HF wants AP to consider extending. HD was asking about the J-1 visa and if AP needs to return home. I told HD that I didn't think that was the case unless AP wants to travel outside of the US during her extension year but I would look into it and get back with him."
3648494,"Spoke to Kate who says all is good, she took the AP laura to the doctor and all is fine... seems just hormonal issues. also, they are doing a better diet; more gluten free and more organic and she says it is giving Laura more energy. She really loves Laura and so does her daughter."
3648492,HM told me that Larissa is great at taking care of baby Patrick. She is learning his schedule and getting to know the city. HM is overlapping and going back to work on May 1st
3648486,"HM mentioned that things are still not very good but have improved a little.  AP still seems to be rather absent minded and careless.  She let Khloe fall out of her high chair the other day when she turned to put her sippy cup on the counter and Khloe was left unattended.  She pinched Khloe's finger in the high chair when I was standing right there and her thumb was red and sore.    Now that they are going outside I am finding Khloe with cuts, bruises, splinters and other things that Malu sometimes does not know what happened and other times she has no idea.  I'm very worried that something terrible might happen at some point.  I keep talking to her about it and she assures me that she'll be more careful.  A lot of times we have Malu do other things around the house instead of watching Khloe so familiy or I can be with Khloe more because I feel that it's safer.  I guess we've managed to make things work for now.    I feel like overall, things have improved but I'm obviously still concerned.  I will keep you posted and let you know if things start to get better or worse.  Hope you are well and thanks for checking in. Told HM if she needs my help at any point to let me know!  I did try to reach out after talking with HD over the phone for some time and offered to do a mediation or to come speak with AP which the HF declined, as they wanted to give the AP some more time to see if things would improve."
3648482,Really well HM has no concerns at all with Maxi.
3648479,HM called AD back this morning and they spoke on the phone for 45 minutes.  The AD and HM caught up as the HM use to be in the AD's cluster before.  The HM reported that all is going well and she is settling into the new home and neighborhood.  The HM reported that she loves that everything is so close to the new home.  The AD will visit when they are all settled in the new home.
3648474,Good
3648470,HM told me that all is well with rayane. She is trying to figure out her classes.  Girls love her and HF has no concerns.
3648468,Things are going very well.  HF has begun to discuss looking for a new au pair beginning this summer when Annabelle leaves.  I told HM about the new ME our region has.
3648465,All is well.  Excited to have Ene for another year.
3648462,Hm told me that allmis well with Katherine. She is going to have a birthday celebration this weekend.
3648456,Fine.  AP Annie continues to dress Muslim sometimes and always covers her head when she goes out.  HF is baffled by her behavior.  They did get her agree to speak to the HD.  He is usually traveling now so it is not an issue.
3648446,HM told me that they really like Joaquin and the boys love him but HM has some concerns about kids' safety and attention to details. I told HM I will talk with him and see i he will improve.
3648424,"all good, they were so happy that Michaela was going to match with them and then she decided to try to find another family in NYC so she could be closer to her boyfriend... told Kathy that Michaela should decide by mid May so they have time to match with another ap if she still wants to find a family in NYC... they likelihood is slim that she will match with a family in NYC"
3648420,good
3648404,"all good, glad they are extending and suggested the ap send in her app and proof of ed mid-June when she is done with her classes"
3648396,Kate said everything is good this month. They are doing well with Paola.
3648394,Good
3648391,"all good, rules are followed and only question about taxes, what happens if ap did not file, suggested she speak with an accountant as there would  now most probably be a late fee"
3648388,Good almost finished. Starting baby in daycare in May.
3648387,Good

3648355,Good
3648353,Very well.  They are so pleased with Natalie.  They are thinking of having her extend with them.. Her driving has improved so she can get out now to do things.  That has improved life a great deal.
3648346,Very well.  They would like to have Natasha extend sand were wondering about the length of time.  And what happens if she leaves after 3 months.  Everything is fine now re the curfew and use of the car.  They have cut back on the hours and times she can use the car.  She does not have a problem with it.  Or so it seems.
3648342,Very well.  Same.
3648302,Spoke with Hm and everything is good. AP on vacation and having a wonderful time.
3648301,"HM says they are working on improving small things and see if it is getting better, but haven't made a decision to extend or not. HF will sit down with AP again and see what they want to do."
3648293,HM stated everything is going good this month.  HM stated they had discussed extending with AP and that the HF wants to.  AP stated she thinks she wants to extend but is considering a few other things.  HM said she will let me know when AP decides for sure if she is extending.
3648289,Good
3648285,Things are going very well with Diana  and they have already decided that they would like to have her stay one more year with them.  Diana has agreed.  They are very excited and happy with their relationship.
3648263,So far things are going very well. The kids love her and are very excited.
3648262,HM says the relationship with AP and Harrison has improved very much. AP is making a real effort to work with HF and make sure she follows their request. There is a mutual respect and AP follows directives really well. Natural mom is coming from France and will possibly stay with HF and cook for them some dinners.
3648260,Everything is good. at their house.  They are busy with baseball for the boys. I asked about visas for their trip.  They are looking into that.
3648247,Good
3648234,Fine
3648231,Great.
3648229,HM says all is going well so far.  Had questions about when to pay her and when she can work this weekend.
3648222,HM stated AP is doing a really good job and very pleased.
3648215,Very good
3648192,HM says all is still going well and has no problems.
3648144,Things are going well and they are very happy with each other
3648128,"good. Jessie seems to really like JOanna. shehas her bnk acct. will get her on auto insurance, confirmed with HF amount needed for stipend and car insurance (med), and that she much  drive on her country license until she gets her CA."
3648118,"Very well. AP is doing good. AP is taking an ESL class 4 days a week, HF is happy to accomodate her class schedule."
3648102,AP Cathy is still struggling to step up to the AP job.  The HF often feels like they have another child in the house.  She has to be constantly reminded to do things.  They have reminded her of their expectations.  She now does drive the older child to preschool and to Target which is five minutes away on her own.  She has made many friends and is getting out more.  HF wants to continue working with Cathy as they feel they have slowly made progress and invested two months in her.
3648093,Everything is going just fine as usual.
3648090,"AD spoke to HD , he said everything is fine with Winta. HF is  on Vacation in Atlanta . Winta choose to stay in Columbus . I mentioned to HD if I can assist him or matching expert selecting AuPair's . He said they still going back and for if they going to continue with our program. They are back in selection but HF is also interviewing domestic nannies. HD said he will let me know if he needs any help."
3648064,HD says that AP got her driver's license and she is doing great. He says that she is definitely a part of the family.
3648043,"AD spoke to HM and she says that things are going just okay. HM says that the AP is very forgetful and has left the house door unlocked at least twice. HM says that this is very alarming to her.  HM also says the her older child accidentally wasted water on the HD's computer while the AP had stepped out of the room. AD explained that this could have happened with a number of APs; and the HM stated that the AP knew that the HC should not have had water near the computer and the AP is the one who gave it to the HC.    The HM also says that she isn't complaining too much about the AP being too girly and not willing to play much with the HC (who are boys); but it is disappointing. AD suggested that perhaps the HM could help the AP meet other family friends and parents (from school) to assist the AP in setting-up play dates with other boys of a similar age as the HC. HM says that the AP is doing play dates, but with girls only."
3647986,Very good. HM was at the store getting AP an Easter basket.
3647985,Very good. HM was at the store getting AP an Easter basket.
3647965,"Very well, no complaints or problems. HM states that she will try and encourage AP to attend monthly meeting as she has that day off."
3647896,Finally connected with Stacey to discuss her wanting to possibly rematch. She said the past week things have calmed down and in addition her husband had decided to have a sabbatical starting in August so they are planning to remain in the match but are likely to end the program with 2 mos remaining. Explained there will be no refund or credit for voluntarily leaving the program early and it will be difficult for their AP to rematch with only two months remaining in the program. Stacey thought Nelisa wanted to extend for another year. They will talk to Nelisa in a few weeks so she can begin extension paperwork early to give her plenty of time to rematch.   Q
3647857,"They are all doing well, and there is no new news to report.  All is good."
3647856,HM says the placement is great.
3647855,HD called AD and said he may be looking to another agency for the next AP.  HD does not want to leave APC but HD has extensively searched APC pool vs Cultural Care and CC has three strong candidates.  HD says he ha been vigilant in searching APC pool (which is apparent via family room) and has reached out yet not found a match HD does not want to leave APC but needs to go to the best candidates HF is very pleased with AP.
3647841,HF very upset about car insurance. Didn't realize it was going to be so difficult and expensive. I had given her options from other families last week. HF also had question about social security card. Going to do OI today so hopefully can answer more of her questions then.
3647831,Everything is well. Lukas does a pretty good job.
3647825,well
3647821,"Everything is well. HM said that spring break is crazy and everybody acts crazy, they hope they will survive it."

3647758,"Paula continues to do a great job with the kids and they could not be happier with her, but her classes do keep her very busy."
3647743,"Great - it is like night and day from last time.  Anita is a good cook, she does a great job.  They love that they don't have to tell her things more than once.  All is well."
3647698,Spoke with Hm and everything is good. Happy Ap has decided to extend.
3647653,going great. AP is getting ready to take a driving course
3647649,"HM said that overall AP Kim is much better than last month, although ""some days are better than others."" HM commented that while AP's back problems have improved, AP is still a bit emotional. HM said that she doesn't mention the new AP Hanna to current AP Kim in fear of further upsetting AP Kim. HM said that she continues to worry about AP's mental state as HM commented that AP Kim seems to be struggling with the transition of finishing her first program year and returning home to Germany."
3647612,Wendy is doing well.  She is adjusting to the girl's well.  Wendy is also driving already and doing great.  Jen is also said Wendy's English is very good!

3647527,HM shared that everything is going fine and their is nothing new to report on. They have been busy with travel and work.
3647522,"All is fine, per Julia. Looking forward to meeting Raissa (pronounced Ha-ay-sa). Her time will overlap with Ana, hoping to make the transition smoother."
3647502,"Gina reports that all is well, She said that Kate is going to NYC this weekend, she also said that Florida was fun and they are looking forward to going to the Bahamas. No concerns."
3647493,Spoke with Amy. she said that things were going well with Rimi. I offered assistance with her ap search. She is hoping to match before their trip to China in May.
3647490,Anne called me back. All is fine with Marion. Marion just came back from a long vacation in Canada with her friends.  All is good.
3647476,Spoke with Tia. All is good with Adriele.  Tia wants to stay after the program year. Asked about other types of visa.
3647474,"HM feels that AP is taking care of the children, and really is attached to the children.  HM reviewed the cell phone bill to see if AP was texting or talking at the time of her car accident, which she was not.  However, the AP had more than 3000 texts last month, many of which were during the work hours AP was to be playing with the twins.  HM is going to address this with AP."
3647433,"Spoke with Yeong Ping.   The family is trying to determine what they are going to do. There is talk of the HM quitting her job to stay home with the kids.  They don't trust Aline to drive the kids around, so they still have to have a nanny involved.  They are also not 100% of Aline's judgement.  Nothing serious, but it could become that if she doesn't know what to do in an emergency.    Hoping Aline comes to the meeting over the weekend. Thinks she is missing her family a lot.   Not communicating with the family - regarding her concerns until its the last minute."
3647412,"HM Gillian is very dissatisfied with AP Jacque.  HM came home from work before noon (sick) unannounced and found AP watching TV, evidence that she had been on computer, and baby Colston unchanged from the night before.  His clothes were soaked through.  HM felt that AP had lied to her about what she had been doing (HM saw through window that AP was on TV, not folding laundry upstairs as she stated she was).  They had words, AP admitted that she had not changed baby; and HM told AP that she is ""done with"" match.    AD and HM spoke for an hour and a half, and HM unloaded.  It was agreed that HM was reacting not just to this morning, but to other things (unfinished work, work not even started) that HM had let slide before.  Today, things came to a head.    HM cares about AP, and it is clear that a part of her (which she confirmed) does not want the match to end... However, HM must have confidence that HC are getting the care they need from AP.  HM agreed that AD will speak with AP, and encourage her to speak freely and truthfully, and if she has any desire for this match to continue -- and even then it is not guaranteed to happen -- that she needs to say so.  AP had shut down when confronted earlier by HM, and gave no reason for HM to think that AP wanted to stay.  It is agreed that AD will go to HF's home on 4/17 to break match or come to terms of one final chance.  HF and AP will speak this evening, and discuss how they want to proceed.  HM will call AD on 4/17 to arrange time of Mediation/Exit meeting, as she is unsure if she will be going to work tomorrow or not.  HM also stated that AP works more than 10 hrs some days because she chooses not to get her work done during the time assigned, so she ends up having things to do, still, after HM gets home."
3647398,"Christine and I spoke briefly, she was really busy and could not talk but let me know she tried to call me back last week but got interrupted. She let me know that all is fine with Laetitia, though."
3647369,"Spoke with Saori. She said all is fine with Ayako. She was concerned that APC booked her flight home through Manila and didn't understand why this had to occur. Worried, since Ayako has an expired visa and Saori doesn't think it is a safe place. I assured her that she won't be leaving the airport or customs and we book many APS through Manila with no issue."
3647338,"Great! HM had questions about how to start new AP search. Informed her that she currently qualifies for early match discount. She has until 6/23 for early match. HF has been very happy with AP and she does such a good job with their middle child, who can be difficult"
3647294,"Everything is just wonderful.  Cata is the best and they don't know how they'll ever replace her.  They've talked to her about extending and they think she's thinking about it.  She's on her way home to Colombia now for vacation, comes back late April and she will be missed!"
3647275,HM stated everything is well and improving each day.  AP is getting better at finding her way around.  HM stated AP is getting along very well with HC and has been doing some of the cooking which has been a great help. HM stated she has no complaints or concerns at this time.
3647266,"Everything is going great with Nina.  Asked how selections are going, they have been traveling, they've talked to a girl in Denmark who is a friend of Nina, but she's applying through AP in America.  HM is going to see if she can pull her application back and apply at STS Denmark and we could then process as a prematch.  They still want to see apps so will ask Ginny to continue to select for them."
3647249,Joyce got back to me and thanked me for my call. All is great with them and Hyeyeon. Hyeyeon finished the weekend course last weekend and now they can proceed to filling out the extension application.
3647243,"Jennifer called me back. She said all is fine with Maddie.  She plans on sitting down with her this month to talk about her flight home and when she will be leaving and plans for the future, etc. All good with them."
3647219,see problem report regarding their impair starting to interview and may leave early.   have been in touch several time the past few days as Jennifer is actively looking for a replacement
3647213,It is going quite well. AP is not as experienced as former APs and HM needs to explain things in details. AP is very willing and a hard worker but HM just needs more time to help her.   Girls like her and HM thinks that in a month it will be easier. HM asked to mention to AP to be more independent in weekends off since the HF needs some time alone as well. AP is getting to know more APs.
3647189,Every things is going well.
3647168,HF is in Detroit for Passover and AP will pick new AP up from train station in NR. HF is coming back tomorrow and AD will do welcome call and discuss a/o meeting.HM is traveling for work to Mexico first week of May.
3647160,"Everything is going well, Monday was her first solo day.  It was a very nice transition actually, she is settling in really well.  Feels good to be back at work and good to have someone at home that they can trust."
3647156,"Everything is going great.  AP not going to attend her sister's wedding, hf glad she's not taking the risk, but ap is bummed about it.  Congratulated hm on her new match,encouraged her to go pull up the Brazil culturegram in family room as Brazil is different than Germany."
3647155,"Very well. AP is a big help. Older son is home this month from his UK school and is doing SAT test. Kevin, younger HC may go to UK as well in fall so then they will not need a new AP."
3647150,"Everything is going good, they are gearing up for summer.  They have been talking about it but don't think they will get another one.  Rafaella's grandmother died a couple weeks ago.  She's had a little bit of a hard time, her mom is coming to visit in may so she's focusing on that.  Her family wanted to go home.  That's been hard."
3647141,"HM not have much time to talk today.  She talked with Sayda about her part of the extension app and will have her get her school stuff completed and submit her half of everything.  All is well, no problems or worries."
3647123,"Everything is great, hf got back from Cancun last night, and glad to be home.  All is good with jenny, glad she could go to coffee night, hf did change their date night on the first Monday of each month so she could attend, hm wondered why it was on the 14th this month, advised as I was out of town.  They are all doing great and enjoying Jenny very much.  She got her written dl test passed and scheduled her drive test for next month."
3647101,"They are so sad Michaela is leaving.  HM knows she needs to go on with her life, but you know, she's such a part of their family.  Thanked hm for all the years.  Advised her I have loved watching their kids grow up and will miss them.  She maybe open to a summer helper if I see a good floater come along.  She wants to help APC anyway she can, so wants to stay in touch and will be happy to talk to new families about the program."
3647096,Just fine.  Michelle does a great job.  She's mature and helpful.  No drama!  Things are going smoothly.
3647087,Very well.  Allison is super happy with Mari.  They are teaching her all about their traditions right now that its Passover.  Allison's husband has the chicken pox right now so things are a little dicey.  She was working on her taxes when I called but was cheery despite everything.  She said they had a great Sadir dinner and included Marina.
3647085,"Everything is going great with Roberta, hm so glad I called, she'll jump online right now and complete her repeat application.  Appreciate me keeping an eye on them."
3647079,Kelly called in response to my monthly call to the family.  She set up a time to talk tomorrow at 10 a.m.  I am sure that she wants to talk about Petra and the job she's doing.  Kelly hasn't been really pleased but I think the problem is expectations.  It is a big job taking care of a baby and two other young children (both of whom are VERY active and hard to handle).  I believe this match will end.  I will set up a date to go out and mediate once Kelly and I talk at length tomorrow.
3647042,"Everything is good, took Radka to the Fort for her birthday, and they had a great time!  HF is thinking about keeping Radka if she can get a student visa.  So they probably won't be having another aupair."
3647034,Very well.  Asli is doing a good job for the family.  The children seem to love her too.  No problems.  HM did tell me that Asli had some trouble with another au pair last weekend though.  They went downtown to the cherry blossom parade and there was an argument.  HM was surprised at the way this other au pair acted.  She felt badly for Asli - I told her this happens sometimes and that I hoped Asli woud continue to try to connect with other au pairs.
3647029,"Everything is going well, Chelsea's sister has been here, leaves today.  HF have talked to AP about extending and she will do a 6, 9 or 12 month extension.  Will have their family meeting on Friday so will let me know."
3646987,"Everything is going fine, they are trying to get Mari's departure date nailed down.  HF may move to Cherry Creek area or to South Carolina so they're figuring that out.  They'll go to South Carolina in two weeks to visit the schools there before they make a decision, it would be easier to live there due to hd job.  HM knows Mari's deadline date for flight.  She has a new boyfriend here, so she'll probably stay a bit longer."
3646971,"HM is SO happy with AP Wendy, APC, and my service.  She loves the energy Wendy has brought to their home.  She can't say enough good things about their AP.  Tomorrow is Wendy's 21st birthday and they have big celebration plans.  They are taking her to their favorite Mexican restaurant.  They have already talked about her extending 6 months."
3646965,HM stated everything is going really well.  HM has told AP that they would like to extend with her but AP is still unsure if she wants to extend.  AD went over deadlines and EBD with HM again and stated that I would discuss possible extension with AP this month.
3646911,Everything is working well.  Silvia is a gem.
3646903,"Great.  Having so much fun.  Saori is like her opposite, like a husband...she reminds her to do the things and doesn't let her procrastinate.  Her husband is so happy too because things are stress-free for him as she has done everything she needs to do.  She has a new headache Dr and new meds making her lose weight and she is really happy about that.  She called previously about taxes but got that worked out before I called back."
3646902,"It is going very well. AP has already started talking about wanting to extend with the family. AP had not gotten her social security number so they went back to the office and they said they will send it soon. When she gets it she can get her Kansas license. She has been driving, the HD has been taking her out to practice."
3646892,"Hm called me 4/15 to check in.  All is good, Camilla going home for a month or so then will get her student visa and come back and stay with them while she goes to school.  They have enjoyed the program very much.  Advised hm that she does have a year to reapply if she needs more help.  Good to know."
3646886,"Great, AP has good relationship with HC, especially host daughter. She is flexible and always willing to help out. HF will go away for spring break, AP will be on her own vacation."
3646885,It is going OK but not great. HF feels the AP has already checked out somewhat and AD will remind AP to try harder and finish her year well. AP is going home to Colombia for vacation in May
3646858,HD stated everything is going fine.  No complaints or concerns at this time.  HF is leaving for FL on 4/18 for Spring Break and AP is coming with them.  AP has been a great asset to HF!
3646852,HM stated everything is going well.  HM stated AP seems a little homesick but nothing to be concerned about.  HM feels that AP is not as mature as some of their past APs and she is forgetful and self-focused.  She parties on the weekend and is very attached to her electronics.  HM stated she wished AP could meet more AP friends that are a better influence on her.  AD suggested AP attend cluster meeting on 4/27.  AD emailed info to HM.  AD also stated there are a few other French APs I could introduce her to.
3646849,"Heather says that things are going really great with Jeressy. Her parents drove in from Mexico last weekend-19 hours driving time! Jeressy is in Orlando and Miami with them this week for a short time, and then next week they will stay in a hotel in Jax while Jeressy works. Jeressy's mother is cooking host daughter a Mexican birthday dinner! She's happy that Jeressy is getting so involved with the planning of the kids' birthday celebrations."
3646841,"AD spoke with HM a couple of times, She is happy with AP but is surprised by some things, one being that she will flat out say no to things, HM said she is being influenced by an older AP who is telling her things she should not do. HM explained what she is asking, which are duties approved by DOS. HM said that she is not one to see something and wait for someone else to clean it, therefore she asked ap to assist her in chores, but AP does none of the chores.for example HM put a load of laundry in the washer, AP took them out and left them in a basket, and put her clothes in the washer. AP feels that she should never cook for the family because that is against the rules, not understanding the cultural exchange part of it, or the family part. HF was having a meeting every Sunday with AP, but she told them that the meetings are stressing her out, so she doesn't want them anymore. HF is beginning to feel like they work for her. instead of a mutual respectful relationship. AD insisted on a mediation before things get more confusing, HM asked to hold off a month, so that the ap does not feel ganged up on."
3646831,"AD spoke with HF , they feel that AP is doing well, she always communicates with them. She drove and did well. They feel that they can speak about anything with her. HF introduced her to some of the family last Sunday and will celebrate Easter this weekend and the AP is happy about that"
3646820,HM stated everything is really great!  HF just matched with new AP and current AP spoke with new AP and helped HF make decision.  HF is really happy with AP but they think AP just wants another experience.  AP did not have a lot of extra cash to travel this year so she would like to see more of the country.  HM asked about timing of AP's extension application and online profile -- they want to help in anyway they can.  AD explained process and discussed education completion.  HM stated AP's education would be done in May and AD confirmed AP would have plenty of time to match.  HM stated that AP is homesick so AP probably wouldn't be heartbroken if she didn't match.
3646817,"Jaime says that things are going really well with Bela. All of the previous months' concerns have been eliminated, she says that Bela is a hardworker, doing much better with the girls. The only struggle that still remains is that Bela has gotten oldest daughter Olivia to school late 10 times the past quarter. Jaime says that she's counseled Bela on the importance of getting her to school on time, and she realizes that Olivia was a huge part of the problem so she's given a stern talking to to Olivia about listening to Bela. She says that there are alot of changes coming up...Host Mother is filing for divorce from Host Father, and Host Mother is moving w/three children to Washington DC in June of 2015. She hopes to have Bela extend with them for another year, and move with them. AD told HM that she will be there to offer assistance should Bela need it, during this time of transition. She has not told Bela or the girls of these changes yet."
3646806,HM would like AP to extend. AD explained extension process and how AP can renew her visa that she needs at least 10 days and should not go home close to her program end date of 45 days.
3646805,HM stated everything is going really well.  AP is such a pleasure to have in their home!  AP gets along really well with HF and HC. No complaints or concerns at this time.
3646801,HM stated everything is going well.  AP submitted application to self extend.  HM was a little upset that she received a request for a letter of recommendation with only 1 day to turn it around.  She thought that was an unrealistic deadline but wanted to get it done because she understands it means the APs profile will get online sooner.  HM also stated she wanted the recommendation to be fair so she planned on stating the pros and cons of the AP.  AD stated I would let the staff that handles extension know about HM's feedback and also stated that her recommendation should be fair and honest.  HM and AD discussed that just because there were some things about AP (she is more assertive than they would like) it doesn't mean those characteristics wouldn't be a good match for another family.
3646798,"going fine. The AP had a lot of friends to visit recently, but she enjoyed it.  Looks like they may not renew for another AP.  They say the cost is a little more than they expected. They have not ruled having an AP out yet."
3646788,"Her language is still a challenge, but Lila seems happy and they have a nice routine. She made friends with a neighbor that is Mexican, and she is dating an American, so we hope that helps her English. I think the other girls are surprised she is dating! She met a grandmother at the library watching her grandson, invited her to church. The guy was playing drums at the church. She also has a relative of some sort in Hartford. So she is finding her way and making a life here. Her parents are getting divorced, her mom moving to chile. So I think she wants to stay here in US."
3646763,AP just announced to HF that she will be leaving and is giving them a one week notice. HF feels that they tried so hard to make it work after mediation and are disappointed and feel that AP dis not try.  HF would like to rematch immediately and would like to see in country AP because they need someone by next week.
3646761,HM would like to begin searching for a new AP next week.
3646753,Zehra called me from Hawaii to check in and let me know they are having problems with Mook. Mook is in Hawaii with them and Zehra was unable to talk at the time. Will resume when she has privacy.
3646738,"Good host mom said she is planning on moving to Fresno but doesn't have the date yet as they are looking at houses. It will more than likely be in June, Host mom will be looking for a job in Fresno and wants ap to stay. She said Estefania is not happy about moving to Fresno."
3646737,HD stated they were very happy with AP and he had no questions or issues about anything.  We joked about how short his calls always are and I thanked him for being such an easy host family.
3646734,HM has concerns that Evelina has been here for just over three months now and is just now getting her CADL. She is concerned if she can drive - told her to call her insurance company. AP will take the written exam on Thurs and then a few days & the actual driving test.
3646729,"s/w HM - states everything going good and no issues - confirmed that AP has rec'd her return flight info - they are sad to see her go as kids have bonded w/her and she has done such a great job - they already have other childcare in place so not renewing - adv to plz let me know if they need anything, we hate to see them go and plz let me know if they change their mind"
3646728,"s/w HM - says everything going good and no complaints - AP currently enrolled in her second class which is a speaking class - asked her about taxes, but she said thinks AP taking care of on her own - asked if they thought about extending and said they haven't thought about it, but will talk - adv approaching 6 month mark so may want to start talking about it - adv if anything needed plz let me know"
3646718,"Overall, things are going well, but HM had some concerns with AP watching TV while HC was napping even when there were things that needed to be done.  She will talk to AP about her concerns."
3646717,HM wants to go into rematch.  AD explained that a mediation/exit interview is required.  Meeting scheduled for 4/15.  Please see detailed note regarding the result of that meeting.
3646702,Things are fine. AP was sick for a few day. HM would like AD to ask her to make up the time.
3646700,see problem report
3646697,HM says all is great and have no issues/concerns.
3646694,Great.  Christine said that Monica is great with the kids and is a very nice addition to the house.  We spoke a lot about Monica's driving.  She said that Monica took three driving classes and feels more confident driving.  Christine is going to take Monica out driving in the next week or so to see how she has come along.  It is her hope that Monica will be able to drive the kids short distances over the summer.
3646689,Everything is good.  We are going to Hawaii and Miriam is going with us.
3646684,"Very well.  They are getting along well with the AP.  It was a rough week, every member of the family, including AP, got pinkeye.  AP also developed a sty in her eye.  But they are all recovered and doing well now.  HM asked me about a school in Reseda called ""Build my English"" school and I had to tell her it was not on the approved list of schools so it wouldn't count towards AP's educational requirement.  I encouraged her to tell AP to go to Pierce College."
3646677,well
3646654,well
3646601,well
3646592,well so far
3646572,Excellent
3646571,Well.   HM Bond asked for contact info and HM Bagnato said ok.  All is going well with AP
3646543,"Talked to Audrey who stated that things have been good with Pablo. HM shared with AD that Pablo's driver's license will expire on Thursday April 17th, however he has already submitted the paperwork via mail. AD told HM that she will contact AP to make sure he's on top of it."
3646457,HM stated everything is going well.  All issues have improved and AP gets along well with HC. No complaints or concerns at this time.
3646452,HM stated everything is going very well.  No complaints or concerns at this time.
3646429,Well- Ashley was wondering if the HF or AP pays for the drivers license.  Cost is 45 and Ashley couldn't remember what she hand Tim had done in the past.  AD explained that the cost of the DL could be handled in a few ways.  Ashley will discuss with Tim.  Will check with Nora to see if she is headed to the activity on Sunday in Sarasota.
3646420,"Everything with Katja is going great. She's been a huge help interviewing new AP candidates with Christina. She wishes Katja would stay another year, but she understands that she must go home and start her life back in Germany. They have been busy with Host Child's cheerleading competitions. We discussed at length Christina's dismay in the lack of selections for APs. She fears that the SN designation is holding her back from seeing a bigger pool of applicants. She needs someone who is mature and capable of handling insulin injections for daughter, and she thinks that any capable AP can do this, not just someone who has SN experience. She's feeling quite anxious because Katja leaves soon and she needs to have someone lined up soon, or else she may have to go with ""Plan B"". AD said that she will email Annika and RM to see if SN designation can be lifted."
3646404,Things are going really well. HM said AP has not ventured out and been able to meet many new friends yet. She said it may just be her personality and she is happy just being with the family but she wants to make sure she is engaged and feels good about her time here. HM and AP are doing the Color Run with our AP group and she is hoping she will get to meet some of the other AP.
3646388,HM says everything is fine right now.
3646361,"HM says things are going pretty well. HF is making a lot of efforts to get TingTing to interact with the family when it is not a working time. HF bought an xbox kinect and have been using it to try to have some fun time together as well as looking up the AP's home town online to get her to open up more about herself. HM says AP said for a long time she did not want an SSN or bank account so HM has been paying her in cash, but they do have plans to get her SSN number this week as AP changed her mind about it. HM says AP has insisted that she does not want to take classes while here so AD is going to talk with AP about signing up for classes again. HM has some travel over the summer months planned. She has arranged for her parents to come and stay and help AP with the kids during their vacation. HF is also planning a trip to Rome in Aug and AP may travel in the US some during that time."
3646355,"Good spoke to  Hoa he said he is not moving to San Ramon but to El Cerrito soon and will give me the address, He is planning to move to Houston within 2 months but is not sure of the address. He is looking at Woodlands and we already checked there is an AD there."
3646333,HM said that it has been a 100% turn around.  Kat has been very playful and silly with the babies and all the kids just love her now.  HM said AP has been going above and beyond and they are all happy!
3646321,"so far so good. She seems very nice. Her English is not good, so she is pretty quiet. The 2 AP's are working together right now. HM is traveling right now. Scheduled AO for Fri. at 1:30."
3646314,"everything is good with Camilla. Theresa had some other news and that is that her husband has left his job and they are planning a big road trip for May June July and August. Ad told her that Camilla cannot really be on a road trip for that long and not be in a community, and HM said Camila doesn't really want to go with them, but wants to stay here. Ad called and spoke with Camilla about it too."
3646302,HF just adore their AP. She is great with the baby.
3646286,"Very well. HM feels that AP goes above and beyond and even helps out when she's not working. I asked HM about the dent in the car and HM asked AP if she knew what happened and AP said she didn't know. HM feels that AP is telling the truth. HM is 38 days away from giving birth to second HC so she is very tired, but doing well. I told HM to call me if she went into labor and needed anything."
3646276,much better now with Maria since we talked. she is a party girl and is in Monterey every moment she can be. she is doing a good job
3646274,"HF and AP continue to do well. No concerns. They are staying local this week, no vacation plans."
3646269,"It's going very well. They took Sara to Sarasota this past weekend, to visit host dad during spring training. She said Sara had fun, she got to take a boat ride to an island, and took alot of pictures! She said that she and Sara have grown very close, they work out together, go to dance classes together, and she's already sad at the thought of her leaving in July. However, she's very excited about welcoming new AP Matilda! They have already become FB friends, and she and the kids stay in regular touch w/Matilda."
3646255,HF loves AP. HD was at the DMV w/AP as we spoke to get AP her new license.
3646254,"Very well.  HD had a conversation with AP about keeping sunscreen on the kids with the warmer weather.  AP was receptive to the feedback.  HD wants to extend with AP, probably for 12 months.  AP will finish her coursework next week and then will get the completion certificate sent off to the S.F. office.  No problems at this time."
3646242,"Very well, HF is sad to see AP go but are excited for new AP to arrive. HM mentioned that she was happy that I have already reached out to new AP and added her to FB and contact list."
3646232,Family away on vacation.   Talked about Karol's food poisoning and UHC health insurance.  Let her know I will help Karol when she gets back from vacation.
3646221,Teresa got in touch with me. The family is away on their spring break and so is Tereza.  Things are going fine with them. Teresa thanked me for checking in.

HF stated that she will take her vacation at the end of July, but she will be allowed to leave the program a little early as family will be away.  AD explained that when AP puts in the return flight request and it is prior to the end of the year, the HF will have to fill out and sign the early release form.  HM willing to do that."
3646155,AP told HF this weekend that she wants to leave program and move in with her fiancee.  AP said she is willing to stay until they find new AP.

HM did say that she is concerned because AP is retreating into her room a lot when not working. HM feels AP is not engaging with HM or making friends. HM feels if that is just her personality then that is fine, she just wants her to be happy here. AD is going to talk with AP and check in on specific areas to see how AP is adjusting."
3646100,"Great.  No drama.  Nothing to discuss.  They are a ""well-oiled machine"".  AP Tati is hoping her family will visit Chicago in July.

3646085,Very well. HD feels very luck with AP . HD mentioned they want to extend w/AP for 6 mos.
3646075,"HM is at airport stuck with a delayed flight right now.  She states all is going great with Johanna, no issues at all. She is a little worried as there have really been no great candidates for selection overall.  AD has put in a request with Jeffrey"
3646064,"Max informed me that Anna broke her arm while rollerskating last Saturday. She is getting surgery on the arm today, at Stanford. We talked about the insurance a bit. He doesn't think she will attend the rollerskating party on Saturday. :) But, she may be healed enough to watch."

3645995,Spoke with Tricia.  We had a long talk. Talked about Karolina's mother's crisis.  Tricia also talked about senioritis going on with Karolina.  She had a talk with her and things seem to be going better.

3645840,Rodney said everything is great with Naroa. He can't believe that they have less than 6 months left to finish 2 years with her.
3645839,"Things are pretty much status quo.  There are always some upsetting things happening.  For example, HM went to select a shirt for child to wear and it had a sticker stain on it.  It is the au pairs job to wash the kids clothes and put them away clean.  Also, things are always wrinkled and put away messily, and that upsets HM.  AP also let the 3 year old sleep the other day during his nap in winter PJ's and it was about 80 degrees outside.  Child came down totally drenched in sweat.  It is those things that upset the HM.  She is not going to switch as the year is over in a few months anyway.  AD has told HM she will talk to AP about being more on top of things and taking pride in what she does."
3645817,Spoke with HM and everything is good. Ap has been wonderful. HM thinks she needs a little guidance for picking classes.
3645815,Well - HM states all is going well - has had no issues or concerns w/ the AP.  Looking forward to spending Easter together.  No other concerns at this time.
3645778,Spoke with HD and everything is good. Had question on refund/credit if Ap leaves after 6 months into extension. Ad will respond to inquiry at a later date.
3645764,"HM shared things are going great. Nothing really to report. THey are having a hard time looking for another AP because they love their current one so much, having a hard time finding a replacement, she shared."
3645739,Spoke with HD and things are good. Still working on little issues. Ap has been responsive. Also reviewed extension process.
3645737,"Going well. She says that Kylie is alot of fun to be with. They spent Sunday at the pool together, her, the girls and Kylie."
3645732,AD spoke to HD he said Maria is real life safer for him and the kids. Kids loves her and HD hopes Maria would extent with them for one more year. He knows she's trying to figuring out is she extent or not. Maria likes to go back  to college and if she extend she would have to wait another year or so . She had tough decision to made but HD hopes she stays.
3645716,Spoke with HM and everything is good. They have not told AP they will be leaving the program yet but will try to do it this weekend.
3645715,Iris called me back. All is fine with Natalia.   Iris wanted to know when the best time to reapply would be.   She has a ton of stuff going on and so she needs to get this into her calendar. She was happy to hear that September arrivals would be great.
3645710,"Heather called me back. She let me know that things with Neifi got worse and then they had a talk and let her know that if she continues defying them, they will end the match. So, now things are better and the family would like to continue with the match.  Family has decided NOT to get another au pair, as they want to have their house back and have a more defined employer/employee relationship.  Heather feels that the ""cultural exchange"" aspect muddies the water a bit."
3645706,"Great!  99% sure AP is extending for 9 months, but HM wanted to know early match discount, deadlines, etc.  All is great - AP is WONDERFUL with HC -"
3645687,Spoke with HD and  everything is going well. HF is on vacation this week in Myrtle Beach and they took AP with them.
3645683,"Great - we have definitely decided to extend for 6 months - AP completes the trip portion of her course 6/8 - AD reviewed deadlines, etc.  All is  well -"
3645643,"Spoke with HM as a follow up to her notifying myself and APC that she wanted to rematch during the APC conference.  When I reached out to her Monday upon my return to the office, she texted me that she didn't need me to come out and things were ok.  I called her twice to try and discuss things in more detail.  She did not return my calls.  I called her again yesterday (4/14) and she answered.  HM states that AP takes good care of the kids so there is no issues there, but that HM does not want to be around her, talk to her or share meals with her at all.  HM asked me if that would be an ok arrangement.  AD told her that this is a cultural exchange program - so, no - that would not be ok.  We discussed that type of situation will only get worse - and will be a bad experience for both HF and AP.  HM feels that there is a huge personality difference between her and the AP.  Per HM, AP has made comments that HM has found very offensive.  For example, HM gave AP a brochure on a Montessori program she plans to enroll Jacob in.  Per HM, AP's response was that she didn't want to talk about it.  Per HM, AP stated she didn't agree with this type of program.  She also stated that in her country, they don't believe in early education for kids Jacob's age.  Per HM, AP then walked out of the room.  HM states that was the situation that prompted her to request the rematch.  There have been other situations where HM feels that AP has spoken rudely to her.  AD and HM discussed that part of the problem might be that AP probably feels uncomfortable because HM has been very clear about her uncertainty about AP.  AD plan to discuss the situation with AP and then either request that the two of them speak directly - or arrange a time for me to go meet with them to discuss how to proceed.  We discussed that they will need to find a common ground with each other so that they are both comfortable and can get along better.  We discussed that they will both need to make some adjustments in order to make this happen.  AD to speak with AP today 4/15.  Will update Casper after this discussion"
3645638,Spoke Hm and everything is really good. Things have gone much smoother than expected. AP picks up tasks easily. HC love her.
3645635,Ad called the HD and spoke to him on the phone.  The HD is going to allow our group to do our MM event in May at his community pool.  The AD thanked him for doing this for us.  The AD let him know that the AP's will bring potluck food.  The HD will arrange to book the event for us.
3645624,Things are good much better than they have been in past. Jacki has used up all her vacation but doesn't think she has done classes yet and will remind her. discussed what hf will do when Jacki leaves. Hmm still doesn't know. I urged hf to reapply to APC as doesn't cost anything to look and keep options open.
3645623,Very well. HM states they had a large gathering for Passover last evening and AP Paola was very helpful and enjoyed this cultural exchange very much.  Everyone at the boys preschool comment on what a great AP Paola is.  Paola got her IL drivers license and is now driving the boys to school.
3645614,Spoke with HD and everything is good. Spring break this week so things are a little hectic.
3645611,"AD spoke with HM, she says placement is going well, she has no news on a move yet. HM would like to know if AP wants to extend or not. HM says she has talked about education with AP and the possibilities available to the AP if she takes them."
3645578,"AD spoke with HM, she is happy to have AP's extension approval, Things are going well as usual, Everyone celebrated Passover last night."
3645577,AD spoke with HD who says AP is doing fine. Everyone had a great Passover celebration last night and AP joined in. AP took her vacation and had a great time. Things are good
3645571,Well. HM will help AP decide where to do her credits. AD will mail handouts from weekend classes received. AP will also look into NCC. Schedule will change over the summer.
3645530,HM stated everything is going well.   HM has not complaints or concerns but she will reach out to AD if anything comes up.
3645529,"Hdad reports that AP seems to be fitting in nicely with their family.  That both the kids have taken to her.  Dad says AP is nice, friendly and seems responsible.  Dad says they did alot of outdoor things last weekend by showing AP around town, took advantage of the beautiful weather. Showed her kid's school, grocery store, parks."
3645527,Great.  HM started new job a few weeks ago.  It is going well as she is only 5 minutes from home.  Parker loves AP. AP has a few friends she gets together with. HF set up automatic deposit for AP.
3645518,Everything going great. They are all still very happy with Anja and they are also excited about their new AP Inga.
3645508,HM stated that everything is fine.  AP's family is coming to visit for 2 weeks and is staying with HF.  AD asked if HF is interested in extending and HM is unsure.   AD explained EBD deadline and extension pricing. HM stated she would discuss with HD. HM also stated it's possible AP won't want to extend. AD pointed out that AP will probably know after visiting with her family.
3645505,HM is pleased with the first impressions. AP is adjusting well with the kids and interacting well with them. HM has not yet made a formal schedule for the AP and she will do that this week. HM is very pleased with the English skills of the AP
3645504,All is going well.  AP started process to get CTDL and HM did receive EM from me re: extension procedure.  Talked about need for her to continue coming to monthly meetings during extension year.
3645494,Well.  AP has not signed up to finish credits. She is not extending.  HM will get back in selection in 2 weeks when pretrial project she is working on is over.
3645487,Very well. AP has met some other APs  from China in area (from other agencies) and they sometimes meet in the park with the HC. AD told HM about next AP meeting and that the HF is welcome as well.
3645460,"going great. they are in Florida on vacation and AP is with them.  They may be moving to Florida, so they are not sure if they will need an AP come July"
3645459,great. Birgeul is getting on schedule and doing fine
3645454,"HM stated everything is excellent and that they have the best AP ever! HM stated AP is kind, a beautiful person inside and out, always helpful and pitches in whenever HF needs help.  HM stated AP doesn't seem to think of it like work, she really acts like she is a member of the family.  HM is Jewish so they went to HM's moms house for passover and AP chose to come and engages with HF's family.  HM stated the next transition will definitely be a difficult one."
3645450,AP fractured her hand over the weekend.  HM called to say she tried contacting me on my cell phone.  It was after 11pm I explained to her that the AP did call my work number and she received instructions on my voice mail how to reach the emergency line.  The issues was that the AP did not have her insurance card.  She never printed or logged into UHC as she has been instructed.  I did explain to the HM this is exactly why I ask each AP do go through these steps during the weekday before an emergency occurs.  In the end the AP did receive the care she needed however she will need to work through the billing now with the insurance company.
3645430,"HF feels it is going OK and they can make it to the end. AP has been having more problems with the oldest child but HM says the HC has been very difficult for all. AD reminded HF that they should work as a team and not undermine the AP, which the AP complained about."
3645426,"HM reports that things are going great in the house.  AP is adjusting well to living with the family and there have been no issues to report.  HM thinks that as APs English improves, she will be even more of an asset in the house and will enjoy her time here.  She continues to be social with other APs and is enjoying her placement."
3645425,"OK.  HM has been frustrated by APs unwillingness to give HM her social security number for HM's tax purposes.  This has led to some frustration in the house.  AD has been trying to reach out to AP to assure her of the situation.  Otherwise, things are OK."
3645392,Going well. Working with Noemie to help her get extended for another year. She is taking final classes.
3645386,"it is going ""OK"".  It has been a month so far.  There are things they are disappointed in:  AP was scheduled to work at night.  HM made AP and kids dinner before she left.  AP worked until 10 (kids went to bed before 9) but all the dishes and leftover food was still left out on the counter. HM is going to have a talk with AP tonight and wanted pointers from AD.  Suggested that she keep it positive and focus on ""closing the gaps"" rather than pointing out what is done wrong by the AP.  Also asking AP what she can do to make her feel more comfortable with the more unusual aspects of this family's home such as the no dairy restriction for Mason (tried to give him yogurt for snack because she didn't understand yogurt is dairy).  AD suggested she get out a sharpie and a poster board and write up suggested snacks, restricted food examples, and more.  Once the AP ""gets it"" in a month or two, the posters can get put away.  AD requested a followup from HM on how she felt the chat went over with AP tonight."
3645368,Robyne said its been pretty hectic lately. Just returned from grandfather's funeral. All is going well with Mamen. Explained I had told Mamen that her zumba class was not accredited.
3645364,"Pamela said that ever since I had a conversation with Kyoko about how she needs to be nice to Pam's friends and change her attitude, she has been so much better. Things are going well and she is just excited to meet their new au pair soon. She also mentioned that Ryan's step dad passed away which has been very tough on the family."
3645361,Katie said they are doing really well. They are on vacation for spring break this week.
3645358,Tae said all is going well with Momo this month. Tae said there will be an overlap with Momo and their next au pair. She will need to fill out the early departure form to let Momo leave a few weeks early and then Momo can fill out her return flight form.
3645357,Alicia said that everything is going well with Maria Jose.
3645355,Lily said everything is great this month with Clarissa.
3645349,All is great. Excited about the their new AP match for June. They enjoy Swedish culture and the kids seem to get along great with their Swedish APs.
3645331,"Talked to HM who stated that things are going well with Dahena, no concerns."
3645264,great
3645263,"s/w HM - states everything going great - she said they are very happy they switched to APC from prior program - she said AP has gotten off to great start, is social, smart and listens well - HC has bonded well w/her also - she has met some APs already and has gone shopping and out w/them - she was asking about the Mega Bus as AP expressed interest in going places - adv have heard of other AP's taking it to go on weekend trips - adv since she is newer to area, would recommend not going alone - she also wanted to know if online classes would count for the CE hours - adv needs to be in classroom - adv best option would probably be the weekend course - sent her email w/Ft Worth info - adv to let me know if anything needed"
3645258,s/w HD - states everything is going good and no issues - the AP has started her classes and he thinks they are going well - not sure if the AP has done her taxes or not - asked him if wife ever had a chance to look over renewal or s/w billing regarding the email she rec'd - he said he would ask her b/c she handles all of that - they are happy that AP will be extending
3645223,Good.  She said that the kids and Aruana were all well.  She was just able to make her monthly trip to Florida to visit her mother.
3645218,"HD had questions about the new invoice he wanted to know what was he charged for. He aid he had understood that he would pay for domestic flight and Sevis fee only. I explained that the family has used 1.25 months of program year with Vicky and since Ni will have full 12 months of program year he was charged for a 1.25 months again. HD said that Vicky did not work for 1.25 months. She refused to go on a trip with them because she wanted to be available to other families during her rematch. HF let her stay but forget to let me know. Vicky's last day of work was April 1 not April 10. I checked that with Vicky and she confirmed that she was not working after April 1. She stayed in Bay Area and also had a small car accident during that time. HF was very ice with her and she paid $250. It was her fault, she turned right on red and hit the car that was making a U turn. I told HD that we will update his account. HD also asked if he could book a domestic flight from New Jersey using his miles. I explained that that was not possible because we need to track APs in case their flights get canceled or delayed, and there is also a transportation from and to academy included in that fee."
3645209,"HD reports things are going ok. He thinks AP is transitioning well, she picks up on things quick and is doing good."
3645182,Spoke with Maggie and everything is great with the placement.  AP is extending for 9 months and all paperwork has been submitted.  HM had questions regarding traveling and Visa renewal.  The HF and AP will be going to APs home country in early July and AP plans to renew her Visa.  I told her about the risks.
3645174,"Everything is well. Dulce is great, HF is very happy so far"
3645169,"Great, she is wonderful"
3645167,Everything is well. Jossie is doing a great job.

3645148,So far everything is great. Silas is bonding with her and Gwen is excted to be here. She is spening the next 3 days with HM training and starting Thursday she will be on her own driving Silas to and from school and taking care of the baby.
3645144,All is well
3645136,Hm told me that things are going ok with Laura.. She is still struggling with her english and communicating with everyone except HM is difficult.  HM thanked me for the link to online classes I sent her.
3645131,Going very well as always.
3645125,Everything is well. HM asked about H form for tax purposes. I sent her the tax info for HF and AP sheet and told her I will check what the H form is and if we could provide that. Chloe is doing well. She is waiting to see if se will get accepted to college to make a decision about extending the program
3645109,"HM contacted AD to say that they have some more concerns and are feeling like it is just one thing after another with AP. HM said that they want to break the match. HM stated that they spoke to AD over the weekend because HM noticed that AD wasn't feeding the HS what he needs to eat each day (HM said that HS needs to eat yogurt everyday because he was born at 23 weeks and he is under weight. HM said that the yogurt container had not been opened , so HM said that she knows AP didn't feed HS the yogurt even though she said she did and wrote it down on her daily log). HM said that she also found out that AP is on the computer and her cell phone all day long when she is supposed to be taking care of HS. HM said that she can see the what AP is doing because the computer and cell phone are HF's and they can look up the usage. HM said that she was very upset because she talked to AP about the usage this weekend and then HM checked it today and found out that AP was on her cell phone texting and talking all day until right before HM got off work. HM said because they have had to talk to AP about many issues and AP doesn't seem to care or correct these things, HF has decided to break the match. HF is very excited to have new AP Marion come in August, but HM said that AP Marion told HM before that she could not come earlier. HM said that their pediatrician told them that HS should be put in some sort of daycare with other children to help HS. HM said that they were going to wait until the fall to do this, but they are going to do it now and then have new AP come in August. Therefore, HF doesn't want to rematch themselves now. HM said that they were going to talk to AP tonight and let her know. AD let HF know that she was available to meet with them tomorrow evening or Skype tonight. HM and AD decided that HF would speak to AP and then HM would have AP call AD so they could talk because HF wanted to talk to AP tonight."
3645067,HM stated sometimes Ellie requests AP to tuck her into bed.  HM said she tries not to take it personally and just happy that everyone loves each other
3645056,Things are going well.  No issues or concerns.
3645006,"An email that Brandy sent me.... Hi, Bella is finishing the weekend class which will give her the hours she needed and is eager to renew for another 6 months. Unfortunately my health is worsening and I am at the hospital at  ucsf. We haven't found a treatment for the cancer so it is very likely I won't be here in a month. Bella knows this and is still really connected to the kids and would like to stay anyways. Please check with Lawrence about future communications and I really do thank you for all your help and tips this year.  Brandy"
3644946,"Jill reports that things are well. She's glad that Nicola and I had a chance to talk. Jill is stressed about having to start the search for a new AP all over again. She said that she got real lucky with the first two, they turned out great. She's afraid and worried that her next AP won't be good. She wishes Nicola would extend. She has thought about just hiring an old lady to care for the kids, but she understands the perks of having an AP, they are younger, more energetic, etc. She says that she wants Nicola to help with the interview process. She's stressed about the expensive program fees too. Reminded her of RHF discount and early match discount, and asked her to call me with her potential candidates, and I'd be happy to review them w/her."
3644941,HM said that they would like to break the match with AP and HF is going to be looking for another means of childcare. HF said that AP can leave as soon as she rematches.
3644936,Paul said Liz has been fantastic. She gets along so well with Nash. She is starting to make friends now and seems to be going out more which is good.
3644930,
3644855,Things are going well and all is good.  The AP is keeping busy and seems comfortable and happy.
3644842,"HM reports that all is well. She said that Levi loves Ap, she said that sometimes she needs reminders about housekeeping issues but nothing to be concerned."
3644833,"HM reports that all is well. No concerns. They had questions about taxes, all set now."
3644816,"HM stated everything is good. She shared that part of the agreement for taking AP was that she had to extend for at least 6 months, both agreed. HM stated that she agreed to let AP leave early and will let her go home early in December to be home for Christmas which is a little shorter then 6 months. They recently completed the extension paperwork and AP asked to go home earlier in November to be home for her bday, HM said she told her no because they agreed December and she needs her help around Christmas. HM stated that she is already giving up 1 month of her visa by letting her go home early in December and she is losing that money and wants to make sure that AP honors her agreement."
3644806,HD says Marta is awesome.  They had a nice spring break with her in Puerto Rico.  She got her first ever jet ski ride.  She also got her IL drivers license.

3644755,HD says things are good with AP and they are preparing for her departure soon.  They will likely renew for another AP to arrive in Aug or September.  HM will be deploying again.
3644752,"Everything is going well, but AP told HM she doesn't want to extend at all so HM is back in selection.  HM has been very happy with current AP except for car accidents. HM had been on the fence about renewing because of car accidents so she stated it all worked out the way it was supposed to.   HM is interested in an AP from Spain and has some questions about the program end date and if AP can be released from program a week early.  HM thought AP was infant specialized and wanted to know what that meant for her. AD checked and AP is not IS so no issues there."
3644732,"AP has been helpful, not a burden.  However, she is still driving HD crazy by the fact that when she is not working she does not speak a word to them even when they are together!  She also cannot drive - she uses both feet and pressed hard on the gas pedal.  They will continue to work with her as they have been so busy they haven't had time to deal with the situation.  HM assured me she would keep me posted."
3644700,HM monosyllabic. Said things fine. He is quiet. but does good job with kids and tries to follow her wishes. Encouraged weekly meetings knowing that both hm and ap not big communicators
3644663,All is well
3644651,"Deb and I spoke for a while. All is going well, but her daughter is getting concerned about Lena leaving. She is still okay with not being rematch yet. Lena is getting an f1 visa and staying in MTV.   Mom looks every night at the au pairs in the pool. Hoping to still get an in-country."
3644633,All is well
3644630,"Good, Want to fill out extension paperwork but were not sure how to do it and had lost password."
3644623,HM returned AD's call and apologized for not getting back to me soon.  She said everything is going fine with the AP and no new issues.
3644621,HMm told me that things are ok with Maria
3644617,HM shared that things are going great with AP and they have no complaint at this time.
3644611,All is going great.  HM is aware that AP is going to take a risk going home in September. She is very happy with Camilla and could not have wished for a better AP.
3644601,"HM shared things are good but she is having problems with AP being very quiet and not interacting with the young kids. She stated that she has talked to AP about being more lively and interactive with the 4 and 3 year old by singing, reading, playing, talking about colors or shapes, etc. HM stated that AP will then be entertaining for about 30 minutes and then go back to sitting quietly. The HF do not even have her trying to entertain or care for the 8 year old as they think it would be too challenging. HM is worried about AP being depressed and homesick. The AP sits in her room all day with no tv or computer. She has a car to use but does not go anywhere. HM thought having a new AD close by would help get her out of the house. AD shared that we will have someone there hopefully soon. AD encouraged HM to have weekly check in and challenge AP to create weekly lesson plans, since she was a teacher in home country and loves teaching, maybe having certain tasks for her to do will help her be more lively."
3644587,Spoke with Teresa. All is going well with Yenny. They have been really happy with her.  Can't believe her year is ending.
3644580,good . different way of  communicating tah last AP have to ask if she is happy. English slo but great roommate and good with the kids AP mother /istr will visit at thaksgiving and mom will leav with AP to go back to brazil in Dec . all will stay with HF
3644575,HM says all is good.  HM says AP told her she wants to self extend.  HM offered to write a letter of recommendation.
3644556,HM says all is good with AP and she's been doing great.
3644552,All is fine with Anna.  Nothing new to report.  Still thinking about finding other care starting in July.  Wants me to still keep my eyes out for her.
3644544,Spoke with Lydia.  Very very well. All settling in really well. Having a problem with un PC-ness with Ludi.
3644541,AD called to check in and HM stated that she has given AP a note book for writing down all what she does. HM will see if it helps. AD will keep in touch to see if AP improves.
3644540,"All is going well with Melissa, no issues at all.  Will miss her when she leaves.  Excited to meet the new au pair and hope that children will adjust quickly."
3644538,Spoke with Chris. All is fine with her. SHe is back in selections now and looking forward to finding her next AP. Let her know she has a lot of time until September and will see a lot of new APs in the pool coming up.
3644535,

3644527,HM says AP's mom comes on May 29th and they're very excited.
3644523,
3644511,Talked to HM who stated that AP is doing slightly better but not quite up to par. HM has been reminding AP of her responsibilities like letting them know when Riley's stuff needs to be replaced.  HM will keep the AP but she is definitely not happy with Shannon as she was with Lucie their previous AP.
3644495,"Kristine and I spoke. All is going well with Misa. She sent all of her documents to the DMV to get her license renewed, but they asked for her visa as well. I recommended to Kristine that Misa go in person to the DMV with all the paperwork. Probably a better way to go."
3644483,"Talked to HM who stated that things with Noey are great they have no concerns. HM asked AD when is a good time to start looking for a new AP. AD stated that APC recommends 3 months prior to AP departure, but since they are looking for a Thai AP she should start earlier."
3644466,HM says all going well.  AP is planning to file her taxes.
3644463,"Fine.  She had a call from Alejandra's new HF in CA and called me to tell me she was very direct, but fair.  She said the year had been a little challenging because Alejandra had not bonded with their 6 year old and that you had to write down everything for her to remember.  She was surprised that they chose her because that was one of their main concerns too and was afraid she wouldn't rematch based on her description, but she felt she had to be honest.  Overall they do really like Alejandra, she has a good heart, she does as she is told if you write it down and the things she does well, are excellent.  She did bond with the older kids and is a good driver.  So they wanted her to match, but they weren't 100% positive in the reference which they felt guilty about.  She said Alan heard the call too and he felt it was fair.  they are happy for her and hope she will do well there.  Anne said it could be that she would do better with more to do. I said that is what Alejandra told me.  She felt there weren't that many things for her to do."
3644450,AP is doing great and they are thrilled she will extend with them for another year!
3644440,Talked to Hm who stated that things are great with Andrea she has no concerns. AD confirmed with HM that AP will be leaving the program mid July HM said that she was aware of it.  AD will send HF and email with the flight itinerary once AP books her flight.
3644436,"Autumn is really pleased she decided to keep Anna and followed her gut.  Ever since their breakdown everything has been perfect.  It was like everything needed to be said, and now that it is out on the table, she is more aware and Anna is more aware of each other's needs and things that bother each of them.  She hasn't seen anymore smoking or even the butts, they aren't going on the balcony or having trouble with anything else.  Everything is perfect.  She still has the daycare full time too, so she works Anna and Dani each about 30 hours a week and fills in with daycare.  That way she can work them 10 hours each on the weekends also when daycare is closed.  She says it has been the perfect fit for them. The AP's get along so well and Autumn plans out the weeks with things to do and they have the Sunday night meeting at 9 pm to discuss the plans.  The two AP's share the car perfectly, and don't complain.  She couldn't ask for it to be better."
3644421,HD stated that things are great with Jennifer. HD shared with AD that they are in Hawaii.
3644377,"HM said AP is doing great.  She said she does drink a lot milk, but is fine with it.  She said the children love her."
3644315,good. jess is doing well. Her boyfriend will be coming for a visit an staying with the family. Asked JR to follow up on VIvi request for docs to submit for insurance due to the loss of property in the fire.
3644296,AP is fantastic and they are so happy to have her. HF is moving down the street June 19. HF is traveling to CA this week and AP is home and also has vacation days.
3644249,"Things are going OK , HM had a few issues that they had to speak to the AP about. 1. texting all day while working 2. talking on the cell phone while driving 3. Ap left the Twins in the bath alone to run downstairs.  HM's not sure whats going on with AP lately. HM hopes that Ap being on vacation this week will help get her back on track. HM does not want AD to bring up the issues with the AP"
3644236,"Everything is going well, hm has asked AP to extend and she's thinking about it.  HM needs her to stay a year, not 6 months so she'll let me know when that happens.  If AP doesn't, then hm will need to get into selections."
3644207,"All is going very well with Diana, no issues at all.  AD and HM talked about getting a new visa in her second year / vs. not getting one.  HM is okay if AP does not get one."
3644202,"All is going okay with Barbora.  She is doing fine, but she is not a great driver and HD wants her to drive as much as she can over the next few weeks and hopefully her driving will improve.  Otherwise, she is doing a good job overall.  HD had a great time on the cruise with his kids, really enjoyed it."
3644180,"This month, AD and HM spoke in person; HM says that she feels they are ""poster family"" for APC because the match goes so very smoothly; while yes, there are adjustments to be made when someone is living in your home, they are speaking about things and everything is going ""incredibly well"".  Match 100% compliant."
3644175,"All is going okay.  HM not happy that AP never smiles and does not take initiative.  She is great with the tasks that are a daily chore, and is really good with those, but she does not think on her own and does not do well when having to make a choice herself.  HM is going to sit down with her. AD suggested she give detailed instructions as what she wants AP to do with kids when it comes to arts and crafts and tell her not to ask kids if they want to, rather to just take the stuff out and do it.  AP is going to take the driving test again on Thursday."
3644173,"HM will miss AP Julia, who ""is excellent"".  She will hold off on reapplying to the program for next AP until things are settled in.  AP no longer has Jeep to drive (it belongs to her estranged husband), so she is driving HM's Cadillac, so she is a little more restricted that she used to be about where she can drive."
3644154,"HM Angela says that things are ""excellent"" with AP and she is happily telling everyone she can about AP program, first, because it is working so well for her and her family, but also because she wants referral fees! Angela confirms that match is 100% compliant."
3644152,Things have started out well and Ap is adjusting
3644112,"All is going very well, no issues at all.  Spoke to HM about staying on top of AP regarding the extension paperwork that has to be in by May 1st"
3644085,"HM Nicole confirms that AP Evelina continues to do a great job with HC, and she will help to orient new AP Zaneta, who she also thinks will be great with HC.  Match(es) 100% compliant"
3644082,"HF continues to enjoy the program.  HM is looking forward to vacationing in Cancun in early May and the AP will be traveling together with the HF.  HF's extension papers are all done and the AP will submit hers as soon as she has completed her 60 hrs education requirements.  HM shared some concerns that come summer, all three boys will be home and that it may be overwhelming for the AP to handle them.  AD assured her that the AP will be able to juggle the responsibilities and get support and encouragement to get through it well."
3644080,"AD and HM & HD spoke in person when AD picked AP up for monthly meeting.  HF confirmed that the match is going well; AP is great, as always, with HC, and mutual affection between AP and HF was obvious, all around.  HF is about to request match with a Colombian AP named Natalia (I believe that is her name), and AP Elizabeth ""met"" her via skype, as well, and everyone seems confident.  Elizabeth will be present to orient replacement AP."
3644077,AD dropped off the AP after the AP event and had a chance to speak with the HM in person.  She reported that everything's going well.  She talked to the AP about extending and was told that AP will most likely move on and return home (AD is aware that AP plans to self extend for a different experience in her 2nd year) and wanted to let AD know that she'll start looking for the replacement come summer.
3644069,"HF had a good time on vacation and are happy weather is nicer now in this area.  Really happy with AP and she is great with the kids, could not ask for more."
3644065,All is going very well.  Minjoo is just fabulous with the kids.  HF gave her some time off last minute as AP wanted to go to Boston with a friend who was leaving soon.  Family was okay with that but let her know that in the future they needed more advance notice.
3644055,Well.  Nikki called because of a problem with Hana's tooth.  She was eating and a filling fell out so now she has a big whole in her tooth.  They are in VA and were trying to figure out the insurance.  I told them this is not covered so she can go anywhere she can find that offers her a decent price.  They will try Nikki's dentist.
3644051,All is going well. Cam got into a little car accident last week but it as very minor. They are looking into the cost of repairing the car. HF is aware of the $250 deductible AP should pay.
3644031,see notes under Welcome Call
3644018,"HM contacted AD on Sunday letting her know that the match was not going to work and they wanted to end the program with Sara.  She  was, according to family, not able to control their three kids and AP stated that she was not comfortable being left alone with all three as they were out of control."
3643985,"Things are going very well , Hm had a question about taxes. Ad email Tax info sheet"
3643966,HM stated everything is going really well.  AD asked if AP had gotten her NJDL or thought about classes for next year (HM had been concerned about these things last month).  HM stated she wasn't sure because AP was focused on getting taxes done which she did.  AD stated I will discuss with AP during MC.
3643893,"HM Julie said that they were on spring break two weeks ago in Florida and Caymen Islands and have been busy catching up with work ever since. HM told me that she plans to look at new AP profiles this week. Apparently AP Amanda asked HM to sign an early release form so HF would forfeit their 3 weeks of unused time in order to get APC to pay for her return flght home early, which I already told her hat APC would not do. HM Julie told me, ""No, I definitely never told Amanda that I'd waive the credit.  She actually asked if I'd sign a form for her today-saying that she needed it signed in order for AuPaircare to pay for her flight. When I read it, I told her that I couldn't sign it because we want the credit (she acted as though she didn't realize we'd have to waive the credit!) So, yes definitely out of principle, we'll take the credit!!  Please pass that along to the SF office!!"""
3643877,Everything is fine.
3643863,Going well. Thinking about extending with Liliam but HF spent weekend with AP and had some concerns. They would like to talk to matching expert. AD emailed ME to see if they could offer assistance.   ME contacted HF but HF has not decided if they want to rematch. HF looking at options for now.
3643843,"Heather called because she has had some issues with Thamirys that are concerning to her. She feels that she is paying more attention to her friends than to Matthew. For instance, she took Matthew to the zoo during his nap time because it is when her friend could go so he slept in the stroller. Heather wants him home for naps.  She also had friends over that smoked (Heather found a Tupperware container with cigarette butts in it on her front steps) and Heather had explicitly told Thamirys it was okay to have two friends over but  ""no smoking"". She also shared that she feels Thamirys is spending time ""getting ready"" to go out places and not focusing on Matthew.  Heather wanted to talk through what she was feeling and how to talk to Thamirys about her concerns.  I gave her some suggestions and also confirmed that she was on the right track to pull back some of the liberal policies in place with regards to spending time with friends while working.  Heather texted me a couple of hours later and shared that their talk went well and she feels that Thamirys understands the gravity of her concerns.  I suggested that Heather put T. on a ""2 week review"" to see how things are going and during that time, no friends during work, no driving during work hours and that she is to not leave Matthew in a crib while she gets ready to go out."
3643839,"Saw mom at the mall and had a long chat.  Things going well.  They are interviewing right now -- considering male AP's.  HD is a bit unsure, but their son is begging.  They have had some difficulties in reaching AP's, but have not started their big push to interview, either.  So, they are plugging along.  Marketa is good -- off to Hawaii this week for Spring Break."
3643835,We had a great conversation.  They are very happy with Julia and wish for her to extend but understand that she may want to get back to continue courses in Germany.  They said that her parents are coming in July and that she has been teaching their oldest child to play the violin.
3643820,Spoke to Nicholas while he was driving.  He said everything was going great and Silvia seems to be adjusting really well.  He said she spends a lot of time with her friends on the weekend.
3643818,Hm stated AP is very lovely and a huge. AP has been cooking  desserts and for the kids.
3643807,both AP's are good and getting along with each other. HM stated it's convenient to have the overlapping.
3643804,Hm will reimburse AP for gas to and from school. AP keeps track of mileage.
3643801,"No issues or concerns.  Things are going smoothly.  AP will be leaving in mid-June, but HM is waiting on her next job assignment before deciding whether or not to get a new AP.  If she decides to get a new AP, she will most likely wait until after the summer has ended."
3643799,AP has strong work ethic and can handle volume of work and right on top of everything.
3643794,AP is doing a good Job.
3643791,HD stated everything is fine

HM stated that they try to address any issues when they happen.   AD asked if AP took her driver's test and HM stated that AP didn't pass the test but will go back next week.  HM stated AP had to go back to the DMV several times because she did not have the correct paperwork.
3643754,"placement is going very well, HF children like Clelia very much. She knows how to engage with them and keep them busy. HM is very happy doesn't have any concerns"
3643753,"AD spoke to HD he said everything is going great with Amy she's very good with the children. HD is little bit concern Amy doesn't have any friends close by all her friends live like 45 minutes away and she doesn't spent a lot of time with them. He was asking me if  I have any AP's in Lewis Center, Dublin, Westerville. I told him I do and I will try to contact them. I told him I will also talk to Amy."
3643686,"No issues or concerns.  HF has agreed to allow AP to return home early.  They have not decided on a final date, but it will most likely be in early July.  HD has contacted the travel section of APC to see if it was possible to book AP's flight for the same day she will be flying with HC.  Travel section will work with HF and AP to make arrangements.  Early termination agreement has been sent to HF.  They will complete and sign once they have decided on a final date."
3643661,"HM reported that they're happy with the AP. HC is 6 months and crawling.  The house will be on the market soon and they hope to move to NJ in July.  AD let the HM know that she's met the ADs in NJ at the conference and how she'll be in good hands there, although she'll be missed here.  AP is also dealing with some teeth issues and AD made some recommendations for a dentist."
3643658,HD reported that things are going well and the countdown to the new AP has begun.  AP Camila's last days is the 15th.

AD let the HD know that she's been in touch with the new AP Anna and she's so excited to be joining them in 2 weeks.
3643629,Just fine- Lara does a very good job with the children an family is very comfortable with her.
3643628,Just fine- the family has enjoyed their time with Marion. It will be difficult when it is time to say good-bye to her in July. Their little girl is very attached to Marion. She is wonderful with their daughter!
3643620,Going well- family enjoys their au pair. They are moving to Iowa in July- I will be sending them the information on the area director there so family can contact them.
3643605,Just fine- family likes Stacy very much and she is very good with the children. Stacy is part of the family and the placement is going well. Stacy's family was visiting last month and everyone enjoyed getting to know each other.
3643604,HF really likes Marina and glad she is adjusting.
3643603,"Things are great. We love Selina. She spends a lot of time with other APC AP, Carina."
3643602,Things are good. We've decided to begin looking for a new AP.
3643594,The AD spoke to the HD on the phone.  The HD is pleased so far with the new AP and she has made a good first impression on the HF.  The HD stated that she asks good questions as the last AP did not always do so.  The HM has been busy at work so they are glad that the AP is here.
3643579,Perfect- their au pair is so perfect for their family! They couldn't be happier with her.They all went on vacation together and had a fantastic time.
3643572,"Things are fine. Disappointed that APC lost 4 HFs in Napa last year. HM feels that APC has a ""bad"" recruiting agency because all 4 families left APC stating that they AP was not a good match."
3643569,"HM stated that everything is going fine, stable and steady.  HF is going to speak with AP about school and driving issue.  If HF extends with AP they will need her to drive.  Originally they did not need a driver but now they do.  HF wants AP to take at least 3 instructor led behind the wheel driving courses and have the instructor sign off on her ability to drive HC.  They also want to require AP to take NJDL test by end of May.  AD asked HM to let me know when they have discussed this with AP and I will reinforce that as well.  HM asked how they find a good driver if they need to look for a new AP.  AD explained they could look at a self extending AP and speak with previous HF to understand the reality of the AP's driving skills as well as other attributes.  If they look at OSAP again, there are specific driving questions that might help weed out the bad drivers but AD pointed out there is still no guarantee.  HM was open to discussing this further."
3643566,Everything is fine.
3643561,Everything is good as usual.
3643560,Perfect- could not be better. Family has enjoyed Kam very much- they thought about extending for another year but decided they wouldn't need childcare next year. They have been very pleased and happy with aupaircare.
3643557,Very good- she couldn't be happier with her au pair. Everyone in the family likes her very much and they all get along very well. Family plans to extend for another year with Tizi.
3643556,Things are good. Talita is on her way out.
3643553,Amazingly well- the family all its so well together. Jori recently got married and their au pair is wonderful with his children. Its one big happy family!
3643551,Daniel is fantastic.
3643550,Splendid-the family feels like their au pair so very much!!  They are having her extend for another year and everyone is so happy about it. They al feel so comfortable with each other and so happy that Ula came to their family.
3643545,Everything is good.
3643542,Great- it has been a good year!! Seanna is extending with another au pair as her current au pair wants to try a different part of the country in her extension. Seanna has already placed with her new au pair. She loves our company!!  I said tell everyone you know how much you like us and reminded her of the referral bonuses. She said she would definitely recommend us if she finds out that someone is looking for childcare.
3643503,The HM states everything is going fine. The AP's driving is getting better. She has a way to go before the family can let them drive. The AP is taking some driving courses. The kids like her as well. The HM did have some reservations regarding the AP placing the youngest child diaper on backwards.
3643497,"AD called & spoke with HM. HM stated that things have been going well with AP, although they had a brief concern last week that something was bothering her. AP has preformed duties well and seems to love family but just seemed a little down. HM asked AD to keep confidential. AD spoke with AP earlier in the week and nothing was mentioned about any troubles. HM stated that they are trying to keep her active and she seems to be making friends. and doing better."
3643477,"Things are really good, Lorena continues to do a great job and is enjoying her time here."
3643476,Not well. AP is not happy with the location of her HF. AP spoke with HF and told them she wants to look for a new family. She likes the HF and HC but feels she can't make friends and has no way to get around since she doesn't drive well and HF isn't comfortable with letting her drive. AD will meet with HF and AP Sat 4/12 @10am to see if we can work things out.
3643473,"Everything is going well! Chane is doing great and HM has already matched with an AP. HM was kind enough to help out a new HF and greet their AP at the airport and take her to dinner since HM was unable to, HM was concerned and wanted AP to have a nice welcome. AD thanked HM for greeting the AP and let HM know she was glad AP was in good hands!"
3643470,See Welcome Call notes APO is scheduled for 04/17/2014.
3643461,"things are good, they are going on vacation and Sarah is on vacation in Austria, all rules are followed, no questions"
3643454,"AP has to communicate and ask questions. APs English is weak and they have found she does not understand most of what they ask. AP seems to be a bit lazy, sleeps a lot and is not pro-active. AD and HF and AP went over this during arrival meeting and HF will make a more detailed schedule and list responsibilities."
3643434,HM says that she is thrilled to have AP with their family. She says that she is connecting nicely with the kids and learning her duties quickly. She says that she is very smart and it's a nice change from her last experience.
3643423,Great.

3643373,"Great!  HM called AD to initiate MC since she would be travelling to UK - all well, happy and excited AP is staying with them another year but worried about AP's upcoming trip home to Brazil -"
3643372,"OK - HF loves AP and think she is highly capable and would be a great AP but is worried AP is unhappy and won't try to help herself.  AP feels isolated without a car, but HP do not want her to drive until October.  There is a local bus that would take her into the center of town (and the mall, etc.) but AP seems hesitant to try it.  AD suggested HM give AP exact change and tell her to use it for the bus just to try it out - AD also sent AP the bus schedule and the location of the bus stops (2/10 mile away) -"
3643366,"Not great - HM was upset to return home after a weekend away, during which AP was supposed to be in NYC, to find AP had had a friend stay all weekend (against house rules) - basically sitting around and eating all HF's food, etc.  AP is always underfoot - though AP is excellent with HC.

3643205,"Spoke a lot to Sarah during our conference about her new match, and Miriam's English or lack of skill, at this point. AD suggested a lot of  contact, and AD will also contact Miriam and speak some with her over skype in order to get her more into the English language idea. We talked of how smart she seems to be so her skills will surely get improved as soon as she gets here and we can help her now to get ready with some contact with her even now. Isabel is doing really well and all is good with her, she has been busy with all kinds of things that she is doing; ideas for a starting a business and other plans she has for her future once she is done as an AP.It is sad for the HF to see her go since she is so great with them, but everyone knows it is how it is when an AP is done."
3643149,"all good, all rules are being followed and Karolina is doing well, spoke with CiCi who is visiting and moving to PA in May with her boyfriend"
3643068,"AP is doing well, HM said that there are no end of the year blues or problems with distancing self like she had seen in old aupairs."
3643019,"Fine.  Kathy said that she thinks Meghan might not be too happy with them right now because she asked if she could have a party at the house while they're gone on vacation the next few days.  They told her she could not and she seemed surprised.  They've had this kind of thing before when Meghan asked to take the car long distances, etc.  They just aren't comfortable. Their youngest has gained 10 lbs since Meghan arrived so they've had to change some rules and make dietary adjustments.  They are trying to get Meghan to institute the new rules - they are concerned about the weight gain and think their son is eating whatever he wants."
3642988,"HM says it's going very well, they are talking about the extension and are wondering if it would be better for AP to just extend 6 or 9 mt rather than an year. HM was wondering how many AP's would be available for a December or March match. It's hard to predict the future. German AP pool always biggest for a  June/July/August arrival."
3642973,"HM called me back. Things with Olivia are going well and HF is happy with her. After the initial adjustment, things are going smoothly and Olivia is taking charge of the kids when she os working, so overall they are very happy."
3642972,"Things are going okay. HM and AP had a difficult conversation the other night and HM feels like things are moving forward in a positive direction. HM said AP had some problems with the hours, AD requested the schedule and reminded HM that AP can not work more than 45 hours each week. HM mentioned how in the summer the kids will be at camps some weeks and she would like to float hours from week to week. AD reminded HM this was not allowed by the DOS. An AP can only work a max of 45 hours each week. HM also thinks AP might be homesick and AD let HM know this was very normal given he's been here for one month. AD will connect with AP as well to check in and see how he is doing"
3642952,going perfect! they all just got back from a vacation to Las Vegas and Kana went with them. had  a great time. talked about their Ext process and May 1st deadline
3642942,Calls email and discussion re: previous problem. AP and HM have not had any further issues.
3642925,"Elissa and Dave are disappointed that they will need to let Janine go, but they feel that her behavior is irresponsible and extremely dangerous for everyone.  They would like to know who was in the house and when.  They will be searching for a replacement AP."
3642922,"HM reports that all is well, they are still thinking about the next year, they love the program but are still talking about it. No concerns."
3642913,All is well
3642911,All is well with Carmen. She is getting ready to leave in July.
3642910,Monica and the family are enjoying Jules and the energy and care that she brings to the home.  She is a member of the family and really fits in. She made special cupcakes for Nalia's birthday and shows her love and respect for them everyday.
3642905,"Neung is very well and happy to be with the children on a daily basis.  Jerry stated that she is more like a ""second mother"" or an Auntie than a big sister.  They had a wonderful visit with their grandmother last week.  I shared with him that a new Thai au pair would be joining the group in April and I would love for Neung to reach out to her. The Liu's will begin there search for another au pair to replace Neung when she leaves and they will also enroll in a daycare/preschool for the twins."
3642893,Reina and Zev are happy to heat that Ona is determined to stay in Chicago and matriculate into the local culture.  They are hoping that her energy will stay positive and she will continue to learn that it is a wonderful city to live in.
3642883,see below contact
3642871,host mother was not nice on the phone. Her expectation is for area director drive to each AuPair house and help them with tax return. I email HM and AP all the forms and instructions 3 times!
3642867,"Things are going well. AP has asked HF if they would like to extend for a second year. HM said she was a bit surprised by this and is not sure if a second year makes financial sense. AD let HM know of the benefits of hosting their AP for a second year, including the cost savings from welcoming an OS AP. HM said she might be willing to extend for 6 or 9 months and was going to see if the timing would work for AP."
3642848,"Spoke with Jeannie. All is going okay with Leah. She is concerned, though, that she hasn't found a new AP yet. I let her know its still early and she still have a few months to search and that Jeff Larson is on top of it for her. She is grateful."
3642825,great! she fits in so well with our family. SHe is reserved hoping she is happy. Assured HM that AP states she is very happy with family.
3642815,Karen thanked me for my called and wished me a great passover. She said all is going well. Ivana likes her new room and the smoking seems contained. All going well.
3642722,"HM feels the same concerns she mentioned before are still there. She has not bonded with the youngest HC which is one of the reasons the HF wants an AP. They will sit down with her on Sunday and discuss the concerns. Some things she can change such as turning of lights, cleaning up better after meals etc but other things are hard to teach such as good judgement. HM will call AD next week. APs English has not improved as much as HM would like."
3642720,HM stated that things are going well and that they love Andrea. HM had questions regarding her extension. HM told AD that she submitted her paperwork on April 4th and has not received any confirmation from APC. AD told HM that she would contact the HQ and get back to her.

3642635,HM reported that everything is great with current AP. They are enjoying her last few months that she has left.  They skyped with their next AP to address the issues and concerns that both HF and AP had. HM stated that she feels good about the AP and feels that AP is nervous about coming over here and she explained to the AP that she needs to trust and that they will make sure to take good care of her. They agreed to skype weekly with the AP since she is not arriving for a couple months.
3642618,HF is very happy and AP did get her driver's license!
3642615,Lucy gave me her new cell number. She said they are all really going to miss Olivia when she goes in May.
3642605,"Tess is great, no issues at all.  HM is very happy with her and she is great with the kids.  AD reminded HM that in the beginning things weren't always that great and that she needs to keep that in mind with a new AP when she arrives"
3642573,It is going very well. HD so glad AP decided to extend. She does a wonderful job with the kids and is a pleasure to have around. HD has offered to host an AP meeting at his house in July. He will do a BBQ and he is so grateful for all that APC has done for his family.
3642563,"Spoke with Sue and everything is going great with Silja.  HF is helping her plan her travel month.  HM let me know that they already selected another AP through Cultural Care.  They switched to CC because we no longer had Estonian AP's.  They got the ""thanks for switching"" discount.  She also gave me the feedback that CC has many more AP's to select from and that she likes their website better.  She said it was not a service issue."
3642555,"All is going well, no issues or concerns. HD says that they are not sure yet as to what they are going to do when AP's year is up. He will know for sure in June what they plan to do about day care."
3642548,"Spoke with Pia and they are very happy with Eliane.  AP is starting to come out of her shell more, and is choosing to go to events with the family.  HM really wants to know how AP is feeling to make sure she is happy with them.  AP is joining their gym today."
3642543,HF is happy and it is all going well. Kids are off from school next week and AP will do some local things with them. HF will sign up again and look for Spanish or German AP. Maxi is coming to visit.
3642530,HF feels comfortable with the AP and she is relaxed knowing the AP is there doing a good job. HM went back to work and it has been busy.
3642527,"Spoke with Claudia about the Early Bird Discount if she were to choose an AP before 3 month mark.  She is concerned about telling AP that they are not extending with her as she thinks the AP will become depressed and that her work will suffer.  I confirmed that she does not need to tell her right away, but they can start looking right now.  I suggested they they AP by end of May to give her enough time to get her paperwork in for Self Extension (due July 1)."
3642523,Great
3642516,HM told me that things are great with Myriam
3642513,Everything is going well.

3642501,She is working out great.
3642481,"HM says AP is experiencing a bit of inertia and seems to not step in when needed when she is off work.  HM thinks with her now being back at work full time that the Au Pair is just stepping back so the HM can take over when she gets back from work.  I encouraged HM to have a meeting with HM to discuss this.  I told HM that AP may not realize that HM want AP to step in and help out.  I recommended the HM write down the things she wants AP to help with so AP has a clear understanding.  HM is considering getting another AP after AP leaves.  HM also asked if AP can work at ex-husbands house, watching the girls and staying the night.  I told her I'd check with RM and get back to her."
3642477,HD told me that all is well.  No questions or concerns. They are still working through all of the planning for next year's au pair and will let me know where they will end-up.
3642465,Peter called to let AD know that the AP had scratched the car in the garage. Peter stated that AP was really upset about it and was also crying. Peter stated that it was just the mirror and the bumper and that they will fix the car later and that they are okay.  Peter said that AP is great with Phoebe and that Phoebe has improve her French which makes him really happy.
3642464,HM says all is going great.  No travel plans right now.  HM had a lot of tax questions that I was unable to answer.
3642453,Spoke with HM. Things are going well with Natalia. Henry is adjusting well to the change. Thinks the overlap helped
3642448,HF is in Canada for spring break and AP is home and is doing local things. AD reminded HG or reapplying for summer
3642367,"HM said that everything is going very, very, very well.  HM said that AP will be extending, but they don't know for how long yet, they are hoping she will stay until at least the end of the year."
3642364,"things are going OK, HD needed a copy of his invoice for 2013 ASAP. AD will email SFO.  HD has not found a good match as of yet and wants to see any new Recs ."
3642353,HD reported things are well. They are both traveling a lot but the AP is doing great.
3642349,"Patty reports that they are so very pleased with Ana and her performance. She has an excellent grasp of the kids' schedules, and gets them around easily, drives w/out any issue. She still has to use the GPS, but she has no concerns over that. She says that Ana blends in really well with the family, she participates in things with them, she's really easy going, with a ""go with the flow"" personality. She's happy that Ana has made some nice friends who are not ""party animals"""
3642347,Overall it is still going really well. AP is lovely and good with kids. HF has to remind her not to have food in her room because of ants and to put the cell phone away during the day except to communicate with host parents.  They hope she will extend. APs mother and family came to visit last week.
3642344,"Fine says Ruby. Justine's mom is visiting for 10 days, staying with the HF. Yesterday Maddie turned 2. New AP Yarina is very excited to work with the family!"
3642336,"Spoke with Keith. Gordana wants to stay in the US, looking at schools. The family is not sure that they want another AP. May try without, and then circle back if an AP is needed."
3642313,"HM said that things are getting better.  Both she and AP are committed to try and make the match work.  Both she and her son are very fond of the AP.  They had a long discussion about trust and expectations.  HM said tat briefly she took the car away from the AP, but gave it back.  She also said that she had a tracker placed on the car (AP is aware of this).  If the car goes outside of a certain zone that has been set both HM and AP will receive an e-mail.  HM said that feel the AP wants to do the right thing and she has asked him to come up with a strategy."
3642290,Good
3642282,"Things are going well , AP does not have an exact end date as of yet. HM is upset about the fees still being charged."
3642112,"HD stated everything is going really well.  A huge improvement from the last AP. HD mentioned they need to start looking for a new AP sometime in summer.

3642101,"It is going well. HM is very pleased with the work that AP is doing, she is attentive to the kids and pleasant to be around. AP noticed a lump on the baby's neck and they took him to the hospital where he has been all weekend. He is getting better now and is back home. HM is a little concerned that AP has not made any friends she spends a lot of time in her room. HM also expressed concern that AP has not the best health. Her foot is healing from her fall last week, HM gave her  a brace. AP also said she gets sick when she is out in the sun so HM wanted to know what to do if she gets ill this summer. Overall HM is very happy with the AP"
3642097,Good
3642096,HF has been a bit frustrated lately. AP can take the car in time off but has to ask first. AP went out 6 am last weekend and asked last minute and then parked at the train station.  HF has not moved yet and the house is getting too small for all the people. Two kids sleep together and wake each other up. HF is not sure what to do moving forward. They feel the situation is stressful and not really helpful now. Will call AD after the weekend.
3642095,H mom sandy is going to Columbia to visit AP  Steffi + her natural family from Sunday= Thursday. This is a true exchange . H mom does not know a lot of Spanish. Kids will be with dad in Georgia on vacation. H mom has never traveled by herself.
3642087,"HM stated everything is fine.  AP is getting ready to leave on May 3.  HM stated that no matter how many APs you have, the transition to a new AP is always stressful.  AD and HM discussed email to AD from AP about school.  New AP wants to register for classes before her US arrival.  AD stated that I explained the process and that AP cannot register for classes until she adjusts to being here and the HF and that she must have approval from HF and AD before registering."
3642085,Good
3642082,Spoke with Hm and everything is wonderful. She is very pleased with Ap and hopes she is able to pick another good replacement. Ad went over early departure agreement. Most likely will not agree to early departure because she doesn't want to lose money. Hm will speak with Ap.
3642080,good. AP has friends and keeps herself busy. Time is going quickly. HF + AP will go visit friends in New Hampshire over vacation. HF + AP will discuss the week vacation and what the kids + AP should do.
3642079,Good
3642076,Things are all okay.  AP is fine.  HD states that all is well in compliance
3642073,"well. AP mom is coming over next week. AP will go with mom to Miami. AP will take driving test on Weneday. HF has not figured out plans for Easter yet. HF has been crazy, busy. HF working day to day."
3642068,Better
3642065,"HM is very happy with Luiza, she feels like all what happened with her previous AP was meant to be and now Luiza is with them and she's a wonderful , loving person . HF is looking forward to spend Easter all together."
3642060,placement is going great. Sam is wonderful with the kids she's fun but she's also strict with them and that's good. HF is planning vacation in Orlando in June Sam is going to join them and from there she will travel to Miami to meet her boyfriend and spend some time at Bahamas with him.
3642059,"AP Lillian just arrived. HF happy with Lillian . She is warm and playful. H mom spending the weekend with Lillian to help her get ajusted to Willian , the house and the routine."

3642021,"Things are fine, HM called from out of town and seemed a bit upset that AD left 3 msgs for contact this month."
3642017,AD had a quick conversation with HM she said everything is good and she doesn't have any concerns this time. HM asked me what Maria suppose to do with her educational component. I told her she needs to submit her educational coursework to me 45 days prior to her program end.
3642003,"HM stated everything is good. AP is a wonderful asset to HF; they have a fantastic, open relationship.  HM stated they have not started their new search yet but everything is in place when they are ready."
3642000,HF is happy they have found a new AP and they immediately connected. HF is going on cruise next week and AP is going to CA for vacation.
3641996,"Transition has been very easy and AP is reliable, responsible and the kids like her."
3641978,HF and AP are doing well after first couple of weeks with some adjustments. No questions or problems.
3641974,"HF realizes they have to match by Monday so the two APs can overlap. They have had two good interviews with Marina and Leticia and the girls will interview this weekend. Denisa has been wonderful and they will miss her. Charlotte, youngest HC will go 3 mornings to school in fall which will give HF some extra hours to use in evening or weekends."
3641877,"HD called to ask about extending with AP sooner rather than later so that he can pay before getting hit with 2013 tax bill.  I told him to complete HF extension app and have AP do hers as well ASAP.  I also, mentioned I needed her coursework completion form."
3641865,Rosanne is happy Edith wants to extend with them. She just worries that Edith will change her mind. Told HM that Edith needs to make sure of her extension months because there is no changing once it is approved.
3641855,Congratulated HM on the match - things are good with Natalia
3641852,"HF and AP have had a good month even though AP got into a car accident.  HC was in car when accident occurred.  AP and HC were OK but HM is still very concerned about safety of AP and HC.  HM admits that she will continue to ask AP about her driving until the end of the program HM says HD continues to tell her this can happen anywhere and that is why it is called an ""accident"" AD recommends HF drive this road with new AP when she arrives during rush hour so she can see the stop and go traffic AP and HF have been in contact with new AP and look forward to welcoming her"
3641849,HM will be submitting their extension application for 12 months.
3641837,AP and HF are getting along extremely well.  AP leaves third eek of April to go home for sisters wedding.  AP is researching travel month or should she return home to get prepared for university HM told AP she can leave 6/13 (end date 7/8)  HM says three of the four kids will be in camp for the majority of the summer so AP will  not be needed HM says AP is welcome to stay until program end HM is trying to get AP into hospital to observe labor and maternity division as this is the area AP hopes to pursue
3641829,AP and HF are getting along extremely well.  HF is very happy with AP.  HM asked a few questions about taxes and AD confirmed that AP arrived late in the year and does not owe taxes.  AD referred HM to documents in HF room HM will follow up with neighbor regarding an au pair HM wants AP to attend social at end of the month
3641802,Great.  Everything is going well with Fany and the kids.  She said there are no issues and that Fany is just what she needed!
3641771,"Things are great, we love tara and she is wonderful."
3641716,HF says all is fine. HD only had a quick question about AP taxes. AD referred him to AP room and samples.
3641700,see separate problem report.  Betina has had a 2nd car accident.  HM considering rematch.

3641630,HM stated she's thinking about a new AP.  She's wants someone who does something.
3641598,HM says all is going great as usual .. they have never had a problem with APs since they have been in the program. AP is in courses at Richland College and drives very well. Their son adores AP. HM asked when they will get the bonus check for referring the Lemoine HF . Their AP arrives a few months ago. AD will check on the referal bonus and get back with her.
3641595,HF and AP have had a good month together.  AP seems to go with friends on weekends which is fine with HF HF is starting to look for a replacement AP  Asked AD to give her opinion on candidates
3641589,Hm says nothing has changed since we last spoke .. all is well. AP has friends loves her family and is taking courses.
3641568,AD spoke with HM and HM said that there is a language barrier however they are working through it.  HM also asked about the AP's insurance plan because HM thinks that the AP has strep throat.  AD helped answer her questions and sent her additional documents to find an urgent care clinic the AP could go to.  Everyone is excited about the trip to Hawaii however HM has not finished packing yet and says she is a little stressed about that since they leave at 6:15am tomorrow.
3641545,All is going well
3641517,All is well
3641516,Very well.  HM said whenever they have problems they just talk it out.  AP has been driving the HC and is doing well.
3641501,Things are fine
3641499,"HM told me that everything is fine with Juliana. They haven't decided about extending yet, as HM hasn't finalized her plans yet, but Juliana might be interested in staying 6 more months. I gaveHM the extension deadline."
3641486,All is great
3641483,I spoke with HM. She is back into selection and I explained to her what Ayfer's role is. Current ap Marina has been helping by pre-screening aps. All is well.
3641451,All is great
3641438,HF and AP had spring break and vacation in March. HM is on way back from Germany for work but we will call next week for follow up.
3641436,HF and AP are going to FL next week. AP is off and HM asked her to join if she liked but it is considered one of her vacation weeks. HF paid for ticket. They are looking to extend and AD gave price and deadline info.
3641435,"HM told me that things are going ok. HM is quite unhappy with ap's lack of motivation is doing more than the bare minimum. She doesn't take the kids out to explore the city, she doesn't inform the HF when they are running low on groceries for the kids, she doesn't pick up after the kids and tends to party hard on weekends and stay up until late reading, which affects her ability to work unto their standards."
3641423,Very good.  The HF is very happy with Carina and how she interacts with the boys.
3641422,HF interviewed 3 candidates. New AP is very excited to come to the USA. SAturday HF leaving for Florida. AP will have time off to go to the beach and do what ever she wants to do. Last week AP took the boys into NYC. H dad working hard and looking forward to spending time with his boys.
3641420,Mahmood called and said that Sophia and Jessica are back from their trip. Sophia is sick and Shamsa is still in Dubai. they should all be back home and in a normal schedule by next weekend.
3641408,SPoke with Jennifer.  All is going well with Yaiza.   Trying to encourage Yaiza to go to free Stanford classes.
3641401,All is fine with Ashlee but she didn't get the invoice last week. I let her know I will get it resent and she did get it today and thanked me.
3641396,"All is good with Heather and Ambre. The family is currently making arrangements to have Ambre switch to an F1 visa. The family wont' need APC for one or two years. They will miss me, she said!"
3641385,"HD stated that things are fine. He booked AP bus, hotel and school for her weekend course in Chicago this coming up weekend. He is also ready to start looking for their next AP."
3641370,"Montze is doing well with the kids and she is helping out more with meal prep. Their daughter is still asking for Uxia, and I recommended that she skye with Uxia so that their daughter feels like Uxia is still a part of her life."
3641358,HM called and had to vent for a while. AP is not a take charge person and let's things slip which makes it harder for the HM and causes some stressful situations. They sat down together last night and agreed to work more on communication. HF is away next week in Georgia and AP did have a plan to go to Boston but that was cancelled. He spends very little time with the HF in time off and AD will encourage him to do a bit more. The boys do like him for the most part but he is more of a camp counselor than a childcare giver.
3641348,"Well.  Girls are really warming up to AP.  They haven't gotten third car, but are making do with 2 for now.  They gave her a cell phone and when HF goes to LA next week, AP will use some vacation days. Went over suggested limits on car, curfew, guests in the home, etc."

She doesn't not want to extend with AP."
3641302,"All is going very well with Carolin.  HF is going to go with AuPair in America next year as they felt that our pool of German au pairs was not big enough.  AD tried to convince them to apply and look at our pool, but HM stated she had basically already found someone."

They ask her not too take things away from their son, Jonathan as punishment and they overheard her saying to him that if he doesn't listen she won't give him a snack. Dana was particularly upset about this. Jonathan also told Lee that Ana was upset with him that he told them that she will let him play iPad and that was between them and he shouldn't have told his parents that. They were asking how the rematch process works and I explained that there are some steps to take first before going in that direction. Overall they said that she is good with Jonathan and he likes Ana a lot. They would prefer to make it work so Lee will have a talk with Dana and get back to me."

3640922,HM just discovered that AP has been turning up heat all winter when HM has specifically instructed her not to do so.  HM wanted AP to pay for increased heating bill but AD stated that HM and AP could not have side deals.  Instead HM is going to take away car privileges as a consequence for a month.  HM stated she felt that was harsh so AD suggested taking the car away for just 2 weeks instead of 1 month.    HM is frustrated with other small issue as well but has not discussed with AP because AP is good with HC.  HM stated she does not want to rematch because of the cost issue.  AD suggested a mediation to discuss issues.  HM doesn't want mediation and stated she will discuss with AP.  AD will schedule mediation in May if issues have not been worked through.

Encouraged Leigh to meet with Maia and discuss her concerns and frustrations and encouraged her to let Maia know that she is looking for her to take control of situations with the kids and show Leigh that she can take charge. Maia was planning to take vacation with Gaby. They were taking a tour out west but Leigh is not sure they are still going. Gaby is off the entire summer and is planning to travel at that time.

3640473,Really good HM is really happy that Renata is going to help with the transition with Alena.  HM and I discussed what I will be discussing at the Arrival Orientation.

3640373,"Spoke with HM.  she said everything is going good as far as how they like the AP.  She said AP is great with the kids and they are really enjoying her.  However HM is worried about how AP is acting with the car.  AP just got her licenses and she is just taking the car without taking to the HM.  HM is worried that AP doesn't understand that the car is a privilege.  HM says AP still hasn't received her international driver licenses ye either.  AP has told all of us that her mom mailed it.  Also HF is going out of town soon for 12 days and the AP is not going with them.  HM is worried that the AP will be doing nothing but driving the car around. I explained to HM that she could leave list for AP to do like clean all the kids toys, clean their room, organize their clothes and such.  I also suggested that she tell the AP times that are ok to drive the car.  I told HM I am 2 miles away and that I will check in on her for HM.  HM was very grateful for that."
3640360,"AD spoke to HM on 4/3/14 shortly before leaving for APC conference.  HM was  interested in repeat HF discounts.

3640249,"Things are going okay. HM called AD following a conversation with AP about some issues in the placement. HM and AP got into a disagreement about a few things and HM was hurt by the comments made by the AP about what she has her children vs. AP do. HM said AP brought up a few issues including how she wishes she had access to a car with HF does not/can not provide. AD let HM know they are not the only family that does not provide a car and they live on a bus line so while it's not APs preferred method of transportation, it should not be an issue. AP is leaving this weekend and heading on her vacation to Hawaii in two weeks. AD let HM know she would reach out to AP and that she had heard from AP by email and AP does like her placement and hopes to make this year work. AD also suggested HM could review the house rules and job expectations since AP has been here for 8 months and might need a reminder. AD liked HMs suggestion of asking AP what HF could do to make her feel part of the family even more.   AD will connect with HM next week to see if any improvements have been made. AD will schedule a mediation with HM and AP if needed."

3639951,"Things going fine with Jacqui;  she does a good job with the kids, and is very on top of her duties.  HP's feel like her heart is in the right place.  However, HM says she seems very lonely.  Talks incessantly - particularly about horses (AP is volunteering at a horse ranch a mile from home).  It has gotten so bad that HD just leaves the room when she sits down.  She does not seem to get that they have no interest in hearing about each of the 12 horses she cares for...  But HM is glad that she has this outlet as horses are her passion in life.  AP wanted to extend with them, but HM said no way; could not take it.  So, she is interviewing and has already found someone she really likes."

3639684,The HF has moved to their new home and would like some help from the AD in helping Olivera develop a better system for cleaning up after the children.  HF felt in the old house that it was too big of a space and was overwhelming to Olivera.  The HF has not seen an improvement in what they feel is a more managable space.  I told HD that I would be happy to help Olivera develop a system for organizing and cleaning up as part of her work day.
3639678,The HF is doing alright.  There continues to be communication issues and AD has been trying to mediate between the two parties.  HF is concerned that AP's mom visiting will interfere with her work.  AP also did not inform HM that 3 more people would be visiting and staying at the house.  AD continues to monitor the situation.

They talked through how to handle when she is feeling frustrated.  Becky said that she explained to Sandy that she also gets frustrated but can not show her frustrations in front of the children.  Becky thinks that Sandy wants to do a good job and will try very hard to do so.  At this point, Becky does not feel comfortable leaving Liam home alone with Sandy for long periods of time.  She does not feel Sandy will hurt Liam. We also talked about Sandy driving.  Becky does not feel she is ready to drive and may get her some driving lesons."

3639641,"Things are going well, good ethics and responsible and values. does a good job with engaging, feeding, etc.  Her scheduling is great.  Calls, email indicate all is great."
3639622,HF and AP are settling in and the girls have adapted well.
3639620,"Calls email to HF HD indicates that all is going well, they will reapply right after HM is through with her tax season."
3639604,THings are great.  HM is very happy with Stefanie.
3639569,"Calls email to HF.  Spoke to HM she indicates that things are okay, not perfect but acceptable.  AP is using her cell phone during work hours so they cancelled her phone.  She is not very engaging with the HM but the family does communicate as necessary with the HM mostly she speaks to HD for instruction."
3639457,Excellent.  It seems like she has been a part of the family for a long time.  She is starting to think about classes.  Everything is great with her and the kids.
3639450,"Steve reports that all is well so far with Fei. They have been busy, as he has been traveling out of town for work lately. He was just recently in California."
3639434,Things are going fine. They have not yet had the conversation with Elisa about letting her go in June. They have been very busy planning and preparing for their upcoming wedding in April.
3639403,It is going okay but HD very frustrated with the AP and her use of social media at all times. He also states she is very lazy and he feels that she is like another child in the house and not there to help. HD has spoken with the AP on several occasions about her social media usage but she always goes back to her same patterns and does not engage with the kids very much. He said they will make it through the next four months but he is not sure he wants to get another AP after this experience.
3639394,"AD spoke with HM.  She said AP would not be able to attend APC meeting tonight.  HM reiterated that she prefers when AP meetings are metro accessible.  AD reiterated that AP meeting last month was metro accessible, and even a 10 minute walk from HF home, and her AP still did not attend.  If AP could not make this event, AD encouraged her to attend the next one.  HM said all else is well with AP.  HM said she didn't realize how busy it would be having a baby."
3639378,"HM Stephanie states that things are going well with the match, and that AP Maria is their ""favorite au pair, so far"".  She is great with the kids, and pleasant to live with.  However, she has has two auto accidents, and while HM states the she wasn't very concerned about the first one, she is concerned about the new one because she pulled over because she was feeling dizzy, and hit something on the side of the road when she pulled over; HC will in the car.  We discussed what to do, and HM will ask AP to see doctor before she will allow her to drive HC.again, which will pose problems in the short term.  She said that she will allow AP to drive by herself."
3639371,Joana is doing great with keep up with her responsibilities until Friday.  She is also training a new childcare provider. Jaime has informed me that she is not going to look for another AP right now because she needs some immediate stability in her household with Marco leaving.
3639353,"HF is happy they have matched. New APs English is good and he seems to have a nice, outgoing personality. No problems or concerns."
3639330,very well.
3639329,"good. HM stated AP seems to be a little sad. AP is having problems with her boyfriend and HM thinks she is not happy. AP is providing good childcare and HM is trying to talk with her. AP would like to drive, but HM has taken her out several times and she is not comfortable with AP's driving skills. AP is looking to purchase a car."
3639309,HF is happy with AP and they hope she feels the same way. When there are concerns they discuss it together. HF and AP went to FL last week and did lots of special visits to aquarium etc. HF paid for all admissions and gave AP 1 1/2 day off.
3639308,"Ok.  She is going to have a talk with Maria about starting a curfew.  She left for Taco Tuesday with friends yesterday at 4:30 pm and came home at 3 am.  AP had to start work at 5 am today so she wasn't late but she has to care for a toddler all day.  Plus, HM had to take the family car with car seats to work at 10:30 pm last night (night shift at the hospital) that Maria needed to take the kids to school this morning because the volvo was still out, so the kids were late to school.  They didn't know her plans were to be out late and thought she was just going to dinner.  After the MD course last weekend she said she should be home by 9 pm and she texted at 2:30 am that she was staying at Andrews.  HM is going to discuss this afternoon."
3639306,placement is going great. HM said that her AP told them last night that she would like to stay in US and study if I can provide her with any information regarding student visa. I told her I'm not familiar with student visa  Ola needs to check online or contact her native country to find out more information. HM said they will provide housing  for her if she could stay and study.
3639302,"all good, ap will take her first week of vacation before actually arriving at the hf's home which is okay with them and we will do the a/o on 6/19 or 20 and still be in compliance, discussed that we normally do not suggest ap taking vacation early in the program as she has not earned it yet but the hf is okay with it. all good with Rayssa and all rules are being followed,she is wonderful!"
3639301,AD spoke to HM she said everything is good. Pia booked her returned flight already. I asked HM if they planning to reapply to our program she said no they are taking break from our program and are planning to hire domestic nanny .
3639221,they love the care Adry gives the kids but the lack of a car is continuing to be a strong issue for Adry. They called to ask me their options again.
3639219,"it is going well, Carolina is bonded and their son is bonded to her! That's what makes this time of possible change hard for them. She takes really good care of Owen They have decided not to make a change with Carolina this month as they have a lot of travel scheduled."
3639193,"Spoke with HM. She is upset over the car window getting broken, as this is the only car for the family. Hm says AP is upset over the situation, down on herself and on America. HM says AP already lost the first phone and they will not be able to replace this one."
3639184,"Spoke with HM. Everything is going very well with AP. AP will travel to her country for a family wedding . HM asked AP if she was going to retunr and AP said of course! HM said things are going well, she used her knowledge from teaching the aupairs at the academy about the normal bumps in the road and has been able to avoid them!"
3639156,Great. No problems to report.  They are happy to extend.  Had questions regarding taxes.  Folowed up with email giving examples.
3639139,"connected with George as I know there are issues with this AP and her lack of driving, also perhaps that she has been a little lazy according to the HF. It seems she has gotten a little bit better, but she still needs to practice her driving, and the Hf do not want her to drive their car until she is a good driver. I am going there tomorrow for a mediation, to talk and find out more and if they can communicate better."
3639134,"Spoke to HM Pam and she is disappointed she felt odd about Mariana, the in country AP she had chosen, but said she had to go with her gut feeling. She didn't want it to end up as  bad match and then have to do a re-match, and also did not want that for that particular AP. She said the AP was not very optimistic about anything, and she did not try to play with her kids or show much interest. This is at least this HM's feelings, and she also acknowledged that it could just be that their personalities did not work well together. They need a positive person, someone upbeat,active with the kids and interested. They also need a good driver. Ianele is doing great, they love her and are so sad to see her go."
3639131,"Spoke to HM Heather in person at our conference about how things are going for her AP Agnies. She said she has really settled in better now and is great, and seems happier. They also have gotten to know each other more so all is good. She has friends and it has not always been that easy for  her, but Heather has noted how well Agnies takes it, even when friends have not been that nice to her."
3638975,Things are off to a good start.  HD indicates that things are coming together.
3638930,"Things are going good, planning summer and in need of a little vacation some time soon. AD had asked HM to encourage AP to attend this months AP meet so she could meet some of the newer AP's in our cluster. HM said she would!"
3638912,"Wonderful, we are off to the Caribbean with Mery for a wedding later this month . We are all pretty excited about going!"
3638901,"Calls, email AP is doing well and happy with her family she is making friends and doing fine.  The family feels that she is doing a great job and managing the children and chores well."
3638894,THings are greatwith Nikky.  She is going to be missed.  HM will relocate and call if she needs more help in future.
3638891,THings are fine with Janine
3638881,"AD spoke with HD and he says that he and his wife are becoming increasingly concerned with the AP's judgment. HD says that the AP had a day off, but did not come home until the next morning. AP did not have to start work until 12:30pm and was not late, but the HF was concerned. AD asked AP what had happened and the AP says that she apologized to the family, but said that her cell phone battery died.   HD expressed concern that they did not have the opportunity to voice all of their concerns at the mediation meeting on 3/26. AD respectfully reminded the HF that they had every opportunity to voice their concerns as I asked at least 3 times if either parties had any additional concerns that they wanted to discuss; and both parties had nothing further to discuss.  AD asked HD to let her know how the meeting goes tonight.  AD asked HD is they wanted to break the match and HD said they he and his wife would speak with their AP tonight and they are concerned that they may get someone else who may be worse."
3638880,Very good ap had her parents come to visit and stayed with the host family. Host family and ap have good communication and have no concerns.
3638876,"Very good, host mom  and host father considering continuing with the program."
3638873,Things improved to the point that the HF and Simone were getting along well.  They have now hired a nanny for this next year.  HM says they may come back to APC in a year when her internship is finished.  They needed more hours than we could allow in our program because the family has a new baby and HM's job will be very busy.
3638866,Sarah is doing well. The baby loves her and she is very good with the children. Still building trust. She is a little immature and there has been a couple of issues like forgot her keys and her English is improving
3638864,"Wonderful, family and ap plan to extend for a second year together."
3638860,I talked with Cheryl yesterday about how things are going.  She said that Charline never got her SS card in her last placement.  She also had questions about her DS2019.  I am going over to do the orientation tomorrow afternoon so I'll take a look at all her paperwork and make sure things are squared away.  She should get her new DS late this week.
3638859,"Michaela is doing well. She will be staying on for part of July, but not working. HM not sure what to do about next year, but would be open to a good extension AP"
3638852,HD stated that everything is going really well with AP. They really like her and she is doing great with HC. Older HC is still having some trouble adjusting but he's also adjusting to the new baby so HF does not think it's related to AP.  HD asked how I was doing!  HF is taking AP to SS office today and wanted to make sure they had all the right documentation.
3638849,HF is going away for the Easter weekend with the kids to Boston.  AP will be staying home for the weekend.  HM talked to AD about the extension and wants to talk to AP about the day to day schedule and curfews for the new year.  AD also advised talking to AP about vacations and if AP is having any family visit.
3638837,"Things are okay, it is an adjustment from the previous au pair personality.  The HM has spoken to her about curfew which was missed by two hours, she is a strong discipline with the children, she is hard to communicate with."
3638828,Linda said that things have generally approved. Although there was an incident between Mireia and Mateo about too much TV time. Mateo hit her behind and she was upset about that. Linda helped them work it out. Both Linda and Mireia are going to go with Mateo to a therapist next week which will hopefully help out.
3638826,Kate seems to have adjusted well. She is much happier and the HM just spoke to her the other day and asked how she was doing. The only complaint is that the HM would like for her to be a little more playful
3638803,Congratulation Katariina
3638786,Sarka is doing well. She is currently on a diet and the HM worries she isn't eating enough. Sarka is great with the kids
3638761,"AP Camila is thinking of self extending for 6 months however she wants to be in California. AD explained that AP can not pick the state. AP needs to be open to all families and pick HF that is best for her. HF will have camila work till 9/13/14. AP Camila will have one day with new au pair. HF will welcome new AP. New AP needs to Drive, Swim, Cook, 21+,Better English, Patient, Hard Working.HF can be picky ex. toothpaste in the sink in the shared bathroom."
3638754,Katie said that all is going well. She did mention that Lais moves too fast and this is the cause of being accident prone. She did bump the car into the wall of the garage. Katie did say that she is great with the kids which is most important to them.
3638750,"I spoke with Gemma. She said the jury is still out on Linda, but things are going slightly better with Linda.   Gemma is not sure if Linda is viewing this as a job and complains that picking up after the boys is like being their slave.    Gemma dissagrees with Linda regarding the twins being really poorly behaved; as she is not witnessing unusual behavior and she has received glowing reports from the boys' preschool about them. Gemma has encouraged Linda to act like an authority figure but Linda has stated that she is not their mother.   Gemma corrected her that when she is in charge of them, she is the authority figure and she needs to take charge.   The boys are not respecting her as an authority figure if they are misbehaving around her.  Additionally, Linda's English is not great, so that is contributing to some issues.   I let Gemma know that I can come by for a mediation. Gemma will ponder that offer and will get back to me."
3638749,Things are going well.  Sent HM the pricing information for 2014 and the discount for repeat families and early match discount.  APs family was visiting so the HF met her parents and brother.  Everyone got along well.  The AP is now traveling with her family to DC and Toronto.
3638726,Good
3638718,Spoke with both Grace and Miguel. They have agreed with juanMa that JuanMa will go home in September after his travel month and they will ideally find a new AP to arrive mid-August. JuanMa is doing a great job with Sebastian.
3638713,Things are still going very well. HM will most likely not be renewing however will consider her options. AD gave all in country scenarios to HM. AP has booked her flight.
3638708,"All is going well, no issues or concerns. Family is finding it difficult right now as AP's year is drawing to an end. They are sad to be saying goodbye."
3638684,"Good so far, HM and AP sometimes gang up on HD ocassionally speaking Mandarin (HD was kidding) but things are going well and he will be dropping AP off to AP meet this Sunday!"
3638676,Wendy is doing a great job. They are sad to see her go. Getting ready for Estella's arrival. Parents are helping for the first few days. Reminded HM I will be away for the first week. confirmed A/O for 4/22
3638667,"HM called AD with a question to ask about one of the weekend courses. Things are much better and they all had a great time in Florida, they just got back from a trip to Disney!"
3638661,"Max is doing well. He continues to do a great job with Emmett. He is having a very trouble some relationship, but the HF tries to stay out of it."
3638640,Line is doing great. She is mature and have adjusted really well. She is very responsible and is always on time
3638634,Things are going well.  HM is not sure what she wants to do regarding extending.  She said that she will probably have the discussion with the AP since I spoke to both of them today.  She may decide she would not like to extend for 6 months because having someone arrive in Feb is tough.  Hard to jump into driving and a very cold time of the year to get out and about right away.
3638623,Good
3638622,HD called me from his cell 310 780 7215. Really gotten into a groove. Kids have really warmed to her. Pleased extension gone through for 6 months. She has done her taxes. Cant come to meeting on Sat though as flying to NY with Sasha and the boys.
3638621,Great.
3638616,HF is excited about AP's arrival.
3638610,Great.
3638574,"Call cell in future 917-855-1220. Linda is doing great. She isn't extending because of her mother. She continues to do a great job, Very happy"
3638568,Hm says all is well with their AP and she continues to be please. Hm is switching to AuPair in America once this AP leaves
3638563,Daniela is a very sweet girl and she is eager to please and very hardworking. She just isn't able to multitask. The whole situation isn't ideal. She is finally warmer with the children and is developing her relationship
3638562,HM says all is going well.  They are moving to Dallas (either Whiterock Lake or Lakewood neighborhood) and are looking to buy a home right now.  HM will send me new zip code once they have it so I can get AP looped into new group.
3638556,Good family and aupair have good communication and seem to be happy with their placement.
3638534,"Good. Had questions about extending so we discussed in detail, including info about extending visa in first year. HF said if they extend ap would like option to go home in second yr and so ap could go to Canada with them in early July and get her visa renewed then. I did say there are risks especially going to a US embassy that is not the home country."
3638532,Good
3638523,Good as usual. Couldn't talk for long as had to go into a meeting. Not sure if ap is coming to Saturday meeting.
3638506,"Jenny reports that everything is going fantastic, she said that Sabrina is doing a great job, she said that Ap took the girls to the circus and it was great. No concerns"
3638502,Placement is not going very well according to the HD.  Please see notes in next section
3638496,HM is thrilled they matched already.  HM says all is going great and they will be sad to see Anni go.  HM says they agreed to 8/4 arrival when they matched with new AP but have since mutually agreed to move it to 8/18.   I will contact RM to see what needs to be done to reflect this.
3638484,Great.
3638467,HM is frustrated with the placement.  AP is very lazy these days and seems more focused on how she will stay in the US to study than caring for the HC.
3638428,Gaelle has been a fantastic AP. She is getting married in June and HF and AD are attending
3638426,"Good , HF is talking about extending with AP. Things are going well. AP would like to take more courses in the fall. AP will have her natural family here the visit this coming week."
3638364,Good Seungmi's english is improving which is making communication better.  Seungmi is very good with the kids and is getting better about cleaning up.
3638355,HM says AP has still not decided about extending.  HM said AP will only do 6 months.  All is going well.
3638350,"Donna reports that things are going very well. She said that Kylie has gotten familiar with the girls' routine and is doing a great job managing things. They are really enjoying their time with her. Her SS card arrived in the mail, and they plan to open up a bank account for her today. She said that the homesickness has gone, Kylie has been skyping w/her parents every night and that helps alot. She went out for frozen yogurt with one of the girls last weekend. They ordered her a new bedroom set from Rooms to go, and it arrived the other day."
3638335,Great.
3638333,"Joy reports that since our last conversation on March 21, that things have improved tremendously with Rhanna. She feels that the family meeting they had on Tuesday March 18 really made a difference. She says that Rhanna is doing a much better job of thinking for herself, using critical thinking and common sense skills much better, and thinks ""outside the box"" and is more in tune to the girls' moods, body language, etc which has helped her manage them better. She says that they now have to work on prepping Rhanna to be more assertive, disciplinarian and authoritative with the girls, as they are entering the phase of temper tantrums.She said that Rhanna has made a nice group of friends, and that she's hardly ever home on the weekends. She said that Rhanna did make the ""mistake"" of paying for a traffic ticket she received, she was driving HF car with expired plates, and instead of approaching HF about ticket she went ahead and paid for it herself. Joy had to remind Rhanna to always come to them with things like this."
3638327,"good, cant believe she is finishing in a month. She is going to do a couple weeks travel. Still not sure about new ap."
3638309,HF is very happy with AP. She is great and they are hoping she will extend for second year. She takes charge and is always ready to help.

3637918,HM had an incident just this past Sunday where they had gone out for a bt and left the AP home only to find a strange man in a car in front of the house upon their return. AP knows that HF does not want guests over without permission. HF had a long sit down to explain why its not acceptable to them. AP seemed to understand. Otherwise AP is very god with the baby. AD to discuss guest incident with AP and to reinforce HFs rule of no guests without permission.
3637915,Things have improved greatly. HM says that AP is now keeping her room tidy and is more attentive to her duties. She believes that AP is looking to extend in either FL or CA. HF will not be renewing as HC will be starting preschool and they do not need care.
3637890,"HM stated everything is going well, but she is concerned about AP's coursework.  AP told HM that she didn't want to finish the required coursework and wanted to know if that was okay.  HM stated the HF is very ""by the book"" and didn't want to break any rules.  AD stated that the HF cannot force AP to take courses and that it would not reflect poorly on the HF. AD stated I would discuss school with AP."
3637878,"I spoke with Doug during the Conf, as he wanted to vent about how Sara had been frustrating him. They feel that Sara has been neglecting Aidan. Marie worked from home on Fri.when she heard Aidan in the bathroom.She asked where Sara was,since she was supossed to clean u after he used the bathroom. Marie looked in his pants and he was very messy. She then found a soiled toilet seat. Marie asked Sara if she could bath him , because he was now a mess. Later Marie found a soiled bath tub and called Sara to show her,as Sara had not cleaned this up. Sara simply stated, "" that's disgusting"" and walked away. Sara came to Marie as asked her when she was going to show her how to use the vacuum.  Marie said it was as though Sara had an attitude with Marie for not having cleaned Sara's room. Sara has never used it. Sara has never don't the boys laundry either, yet left a small load on the drier unfolded when she did her own. I suggested he start interviewing asap,as of today, they had not done this. Sara spent the majority of the weekend with Camila & her HF again this weekend. Sara did not come home last night, nor did she inform her HF that she was going to do this. Doug had to call her this morning to see where she was and if she was going to show up for work. They had no idea if she was out drinking all night and would be hung over and too tired to care for the boys. I asked her if she apologized, she did not. I asked her why she felt an apology was not necessary. Marie said that she & Doug had a conversation with Sara, asking her what she expected out of the program. Marie said that she pretty much ignored them. They explained how they have made the needed changes that Sara asked for, including dinner together, yet she refuses to join them. Sara said they should text her the time for dinner. Doug said that Marie is not her mother and that she should take responsibility to see what time dinner will be served. I told Marie that I believed that Sara could have the qualities of a successful au pair despite their bad connection. I suggested they interview aggressively if they want to make the next arrival date Marie said that her daughter inlaw will sit for the boys if Sara does not want to stay on happily until the new AP arrives."

Asja reminded Andrea that she agreed to work Thurs night, to which Andrea denied, stating that she would never agree to work on the same evening of her zumba class. Asja admits that she kind of sarcastically said ""You will survive without zumba"" which got Andrea very upset.

She says that ever since they found out she has a boyfriend who lives in MD AP leaves to spend time with him. She says that she feels like AP's priorities are her boyfriends and school. She says that she is taking their car to MD ( one hour away) without asking (sometimes twice a day)and says that this was not in the agreement.

They are seeing her more than before, but she still doesn't get the feeling that she talks to the kids a lot.  They aren't talking a lot and she is worried about their language development.  There have been a few other strange social things, like her friend came to get her and parked at the house before theirs.  Jen was talking to a neighbor and when she turned around, the car and June were gone.  She thought it was strange that the person parked away and they didn't speak or say hello/goodbye.

3636317,Spoke with HD Steve who called with questions about extending 6 months vs 1 year.  He was concerned that the pool of AP's would be smaller for a February arrival vs August arrival (specifically with German AP's).  I explained that pool remains same size throughout the year but the nationalities differ with season.  German AP's tends to be more in the summer months.

(I am going to call the AP to discuss) The HM is on the verge of requesting a rematch.  I just visited with the family for a mediation, so the HM did not see a need for a second one.  She had discussed her concerns with the AP and will make a decision on the rematch soon."
3635161,"I spoke to the HD and he stated the AP has not improved in her driving.  Therefore, he and his wife have decided they would like to rematch.  The AP will be notified but it should not be a surprise to her. She pulled out into traffic on a busy highway and endangered the children again."

Alexa shared with me that Kyra and she had 2 very long conversations where she told her about her past, her mother committed suicide when she was 5 years old and her step-mom just let them raise themselves basically so she gets the feeling she feels abandoned. She shared that she would drink alcohol at age 13 from her parents cabinet.  Alexa has tried to set up something at the church for someone to have her talk to as she is a little worried about her mental state so will watch her closely.  So far she has been patient with the kids, happy and comes along with her wherever she goes.  She gives the kids 3 warnings and then time out and this has been good."

3633847,"Great.  She said it has been better for the last few weeks than ever.  She thinks it is because she is meeting more friends and getting out.  She said the AP did come to her and ask her if they trusted her.  HM told her they did with their children, but not so much when it comes to taking care of herself."
3633846,Sally got the newsletter and called to check in and let me know things are going well with Stepanka.  She asked for the second week in August off and then a week in the fall but the hf takes the last 2 weeks of August so were hoping she would take it then... they may compromise and have her take the week in August she requested and then the following week which is when they are on vacation.  She wants to vacation with another ap who can only take that week.
3633775,"HM Missy said that AP Nikol is ""wonderful."" HM asked me again whether she needs to provide AP Nikol with a 1099 form for her taxes and I said no. HM asked whether she should use TurboTax to do AP's taxes and I said that all she needs to do is to follow all the instructions, including the sample cheat sheet and sample completed 1040NR-EZ form  sent her. HM said that she didn't want to pay her CPA extra money to do her AP's tax form and I said that all she needs to do is do the tax form manually following the instructions I provided. Lastly, HM asked if I heard what happened to the other Czech AP Lucie who was mugged and I said yes. HM said that she told her AP Nikol not to visit Lucie because of the apparent unsafe neighborhood. HM said that her AP Nikol hasn't been spending much time with AP Lucie. Instead, she is hanging out with a nearby Polish nanny. HM said that she was more comfortable with that as she knows the Polish nanny's employer."
3633773,"HD said that everything is going great with AP Cindy. HD als added, ""Little jack is growing by the day and eating a lot more than Ford did at this same age. Sleeping is improving, but we're still getting up 1/2x night.  Hopefully just a few more months to go!"" HD asked if they would be receiving a refund for referring the Conways to APC but then his wife told him that the Conways matched with another firm (CC.)

AD shared that they do not need to give her that money and it is supposed to be used only for classes. They are a little worried about new AP working hard now that the other AP is leaving as the past few weeks have been light and easy for her. The HF feels like the AP's are turning into ""premadonna's"" and thinking money grows on trees. AD encouraged to communicate and be direct and up front about everything, share with them all the little things that she does above and beyond what she is supposed to do."

She made an appt for permit test, but HM says AP needs to learn the rules first."
3633498,HM returned my call.  She said she is very sad their AP will be leaving.  She said she has a boyfriend at home who is an attorney and she is ready to get back.  She said she has a really strong interview going with an AP and she has her fingers crossed they will match.

The other day she came home at 7:30 am and started working at 8 am. HF is considering setting up a curfew. HD said Sawa complains lately that 45 hours of child care is too much and wants more tie off. She always ask H for more time off and once she told her that she should have done more because she is stay at home mom. HD said that his wife almost died two years ago giving birth to the twins and still has a lot of health issues. She cannot carry anything heavy and she is not supposed to get tired that is why they have an AP. HM feels bad when AP tells her thing like that and she does not know how to say no when AP asks to leave work early.   HD said that Sawa is great with the kids and there is nothing to complain about her work. Last month in Hawaii AP was out drinking every night and would come home late and drunk. HF did not mind because they were all there together and they thought she should have some fun time so they gave her mornings off and more time off. Since hey came back Sawa has asked almost every day to finish her day early.  I will meet with the AP tomorrow night at 8 pm, at A'Cuppa Tea to check what is going on."

3631010,"Great with Julia. She just returned from brazil. She was slightly upset with Katka regarding an incident up in Vermont while vacationing. One of the HC was getting tired and acting out and so Katka took her off the slopes, even though Alison did not see the incident a fellow skier told HM that Katka was being mean to the HC. HM was slightly concerned but has spoken to Katka about the incident and seems ok with the situation for now. It seems that HM is just not used to a different parenting style. It seems like HM wants a more relaxed discipline style whereas Katka uses time outs/take aways more often. I asked the HM to keep communication open and to speak freely to Katka about HM wishes in discipline. KAtka will only learn if shown/told what HM wants. I believe that Katka is very loving to the children and is trying very hard in her role. HOwever, I tolf HM I will also speak to Katka about discipline Modification."

When HM stated she would change Aps hrs to work on Saturday, Ap said she cannot as she promised the other family to babysit. HM then told AP if she goes to babysit, she cannot work for them on Sun.Mon or Tues so if she was contaminated by the other children, she will not get their son sick again. HP considering going into rematch, as AP has had an attitude, does not include herself as a part of the family, has to be reminded of her duties.HP concerned as well as AP is on her cell phone as soon as the Hp take the baby from her. AP has very little or no interaction with the family."

AP doesn't think it is fair that she should have to ride the bus one hour each way to get to class.I asked HF is she rode the bus to class every day would they be willing to P/U at 9:30 every night and they said that would be too much. tehy said they might 2 nights a week.

3628870,"All is going well, no issues or concerns. HM said that they are thinking about getting a nanny once Paula is done with her year. HD will not be travelling so much so they do not need someone for 45 hours a week."
3628866,Vera thanked me for my call. All is going well with Sandra.   Spring break coming up.
3628861,Things are fine with Carmen. Still a bit tentative on the driving.   Thanked me for the call. Spring break coming up.

Alex has been great with Avery over the past 2 weeks keeping her very busy and active and happy since Mommy has been under the weather.  Malia stated that her and Alex are in a great place with communication and appreciation of each other.
3628844,lauren says that things are great and that Lilly is doing a good job - everyone is waiting for some warm weather to come.  Lilly went to NYC and Washington DC and had a great time with some of the other au pairs.  She has a lot of friends and it is nice that she is enjoying herself.  I told Lauren that Lilly said she was very happy.
3628842,Things are going very well so far. They went to the SS office today.
3628832,Sarah's business is doing well and she is working from home.  It has been an adjustment for the kids as they see her and I gave her some tips and how to work from home and keep the kids from interrupting her.  Bere is great and has made some good friends.
3628826,Things are going very well.  HM said it is nice to have an AP that does not stay out until 2 or 3 in the morning.  She's typically home by 11pm.  AP will be going to FL with the family.
3628822,ellen was with a client when I called but said that things are great - they love Maria.  Everyone waiting for some warmer weather as we have had a terrible winter.
3628816,"AD spoke to HM.  She said they are perfect--no complaints.  HC is going to preschool 2 times a week for 3 hours each.  HM said they have not been asking AP to make up those hours, even though they are allowed to.  She said AP has a good gig going, but they are so happy with her, it is worth it.  She said she wished she could extend AP longer because HC is so attached to her."
3628811,Jake says that things are going well - Verena is doing well and they have been busy with skiing etc.  The camp is getting all the reservations done and everyone is just waiting for some warm weather.  It has been such a long winter.
3628802,"Jennifer says that Chris is really good with the kids - she is strict and sometimes feels that she is a little overstrict as she gets the children to tidy their rooms, empty the dishwasher and make their beds but the problem she is having is with Harvard as the classes there do not coincide with school vacation week here.  They are hoping to set up play dates to that Chris can attend class but if the playdates fall through then Chris will have to miss class."
3628798,"AD spoke to HD, who was at work.  He said they have had a magnificent time with Yada, and all is well.  He said he and his wife are not fans of drama, and AP is a very calm person, so match has been great."
3628786,"All's great with Lisa. The kids are now all signed up for baseball, golf, swimming lessons & camp so Lisa will definitely have a busy summer."
3628782,"Off to a good start, AP is a big sister type and enjoys spending time with HF. She is working on her FLDL and practicing driving the van. AP met Julie, another local AP. AP learning to cook Indian food w/hdad's sister! She also has made them Brazilian food."
3628771,"Great, HF has sold house. AD told hmom about new local au pairs coming this month. AP is completing her classes and HF/AD are helping her find something."
3628764,"Great, AP is already done with taxes, HF continues to feel she is a wonderful au pair. Hmom travels a lot and Lynda is comfortable and helpful when alone with hdad and child.."
3628759,AD called to reconfirm with HM that I had received her e-mail requesting APC Academy educate APs on the danger of downed power lines.  (See e-mail below).
3628758,"Camilla told me that she wanted to return to Brazil because her father may have brain cancer and her brother was having issues with drugs. She said that she no longer wanted to be an AP, that she is too worried and felt it best to return home. As it turns out, Camila had been spending all of her time off at her boyfriends parents home and her relationship with her HF had become more like an employee/employer relationship, causing Camila to lose interest in working as an AP. Camila said it was a long winter and she did not enjoy waking up each day going to her HF's to work,when she was unable to take them outdoors. I was unaware of this arrangement. I have spoke with all parties regarding the DOS guidelines are in place and must be followed. I spoke with all parties several times during the last few weeks, as I learned of Camila's desire to return home early. I met with her this past Tues. evening for 2.5 hours and learned these facts and that she actually wants to leave immediately. I met with Jill & Camila yesterday, so share this with my HF. Jill was very upset and felt that Camila was being very unfair to let ,leaving them in a bad situation regarding childcare for the next five weeks. They feel Camila took advantage of their kindness,as she knew she was feeling this way for many months, yet still brought her mother her for a month and an half and took a week off. They would not have used their vacation time if they knew she was going to leave them without childcare. Jill just went to PT, so her patients are doubled up and her calender is full for the next several months,leaving her not time to take off work. Jill i extremely stressed by this and concerned about her job."
3628737,"HM said Krishna is doing great.  She said they have been doing home renovations, and AP is handling the upheaval with style!"
3628714,"AD spoke to HM.  She said AP is doing a good job.  She and her son are on vacation in San Francisco, and AP is on vacation with his family in Aspen.  HM said AP got in a 2nd car accident that he did not tell her about, and would not admit to, but said the front bumper of her car was damaged after his first accident.  Other than that, she said things are fine."
3628696,HF and AP are extremely happy.  The match is going well
3628678,David called me. He said things are all good with Rebecca.
3628671,Hmom reports that all is well with AP that she continues to do well.  They are not going anywhere over their spring break so AP will work the same schedule but Hmom is taking some time off from work to take the kids on a few short day trips into Chicago to keep AP from going over her 10 hours a day.
3628670,"Finally managed to speak to Zola. She still has some concerns about a good fit with Myriam, mainly that she doesn't seem to have much experience looking after little ones and seems a bit overwhelmed. Eg fed them cheese for bfast so now HM has to tell her specifically what to give them. Also ap didn't tell hm when daughter had a splinter in her hand. HM said ap still has a problem with BO also. HM is going to talk to ap again and will let me know how it goes. We are going to follow up in a couple of weeks and if things still haven't improved consider a mediation at that point."
3628647,She is doing ok.  She was sick with a fever and she isn't sure if she was just tired but she wants to make sure she is ok.  I called and left Carol a message.
3628637,"Well.  They are getting a dog Saturday from Virginia and Gisele is very eager. The kids are back from their trips and getting back acclimated to the time zone, waking him up at 2:30 am asking for dinner.  he also gets them 2 weeks in June and has to figure out what to do...maybe Hawaii.  Gisele will go with them too.  He said Gisele doesn't have a ton of experience with kids and sometimes they walk all over her.  But on the other hand, they do that to him too.  Luckily they are good at school.    The yard and pool are settled so he may be able to have a au pair gathering for the world cup."
3628636,"Hmom reports that she was a bit perturbed when AP came to her saying she is working too many hours.  But after Hmom and AP discussed the recent work schedule, hmom realizes she may have lost track of hours and  gone over the 45 hour work week by a few hours.  Hmom and AP have decided to keep a better written schedule of APs hours so that it doesn't happen again. Hmom just felt as though AP was accusing her of making her work more hours then she should but after the two talked Hmom realized AP wasn't accusing her it was more APs lack of english skills that prevented AP from being able to explain herself in a nicer way to Hmom.  All is well now.  Hmom says AP is looking forward to her mom and brother coming to U.S. in April for a week visit."
3628635,Lynn said everything is fine.  She said Kathy told her she wanted to try to extend in New York or California (she has family in California) but if she couldn't find a family she would stay with the Lawyers.  I told her I would check into this and see if that's possible.  I also talked to her about figuring out how much time she would need to match to figure out how long Kathy would be able to attempt to match elsewhere.  I also reminded her about the priority match discount for matching with someone else if necessary.
3628623,"Hm told me that all is great with Lizzie. She is very flexible and helpful with the boys during the divorce and has bonded beautifully with them. She is a good cook and overall HM is very happy with her. HM's only disappoitment was that Lizzie had a small accident with the car and hit a parking pole with the side of the car and caused about $2,000 and didn't seem too sorry. Also she is not always careful with money when buying her own food and HM will find a nice way to address this with her."
3628596,Things are going well.  HD said he did know that Vanessa is struggling a bit with her writing class and he has been trying to help her.
3628569,really well-- AP is very experienced and is actually helping me mother!  Looking forward to gong to Bahamas for a wedding with AP

3628528,"HM says things are good, getting used to living n the suburbs.   Has been very busy at work, but things are good with Sophia"
3628510,All is well. HM told me they will be in Ireland from April 18th to May 4th and they will spend a weekend with their previous ap.  Cristina will have those 2 weeks off and her sister and husband will come to visit her and stay with her for the first week. She will then go to Hawaii.
3628508,"Hmom reports her daughter Frida is sick and has stayed home from school so it has actually given both AP Eliana and Frida a chance to get to know each other and start a bond. Hmom is excited that AP can teach daughter Frida some spanish, they have been playing some basic games in Spanish and says Daughter and AP seem to be having fun with one another."
3628505,"HD told me that all is well.  I asked hime if they are interested in finding a new ap and he confirmed, so I urged him to renw the application and start their search, especially uif they want an overlap."
3628492,They are happy with Nagyla and feel that she is settling in nicely. She is eager to please and is very helpful around the house and with the kids.  They underestimated the challenges of having a more inexperienced English speaker but she does a good job of communicating when she needs things repeated or said differently.
3628480,Chelsea said they're doing great.  She said Lorraine is a much better fit and its been like night and day (versus with Laura).  She said the kids love Lorraine and Lorraine's driving is good.
3628474,First week is going well. Former AP was there the first days to help and explain schedule etc. AP is now taking over and feels good about her responsibilities and HF. Girls are warming up to AP

AD explained that I asked the hospital to also send AD a packet for further support of AP.  Hospital agreed.  Hm was relieved.  No concerns.
3628464,Moving in June- will update once it is settled.  Flying twice today so tomorrow will be a better day to catch up.
3628463,Holly said they're great.  She said she is going to email a recommendation for Cintia's profile.  She said they don't need an au pair during the summer so they are going to take some time to see if they need another au pair.

3628452,All is well

3628426,Going well.
3628424,"Lilah is well.  She is happy with Julia and wishes that she could stay another year.  Julia's father is ill and Julia will be joining her family for a vacation in Brussels next month.   Lilah is prepared to reapply for a new program year.  She would like to take advantage of the 1,100 in savings for matching early, no application fee and repeat family discount.  She would like for Ginny to reach out with suggestions.  She would like to make the April 15th deadline."
3628421,"HM shared that things are going great as usual.  Shared all of the travel adventures they have had and that they are very happy with the AP of course, she joked.  Feels the AP is exceptional and they are glad she is a part of their lives.  Talked about next AP and process. Shared now is the time to reapply and begin interviews."

3628399,"Hmom reports that all is great with AP Oriane.  Mom says AP is in mexico, went with a couple of other APs and they are visiting a former AP who is from Mexico.  Mom said she and AP will be extending with one another for at least another 9 months and possibly 12 mos. Mom reports that AP continues to be very responsible and provides great childcare for the family. Mom says the kids adore Oriane."
3628397,HD shared that things are going well and has no complaints.  The family are truly enjoying the AP and she has been one of the best ones they have had she disclosed.  Extremely happy.
3628386,"It's going real well. She apologized for not calling me back. They have been super busy with spring break-they went on vacation to Georgia, to HM's father's cabin. She says that Heemin has definitely decided to not extend, and she wishes to not only return home, but travel at the end of her program year in the NE with her sister. Leslie says that she, James and Heemin must sit down and work out a timeline, as to when Heemin can leave, as well as when the new AP would come, and she might want a week of overlap between the two so that Heemin can train new person. She also has to figure out these schedules so that they coordinate with when her boys will be home, because they always go to their dad's place in NC for the summer, and she wants to make sure that the boys are here when new AP arrives so that the AP will have something to do. She's considering getting a male AP this time, as kids are getting older and she thinks it would be fun for them to have a 'big brother"" around."
3628385,Stacey called me back a few days ago. Nothing new with Linnea. All is great.
3628384,Amy reports that all is well. Amy apologized for not returning my phone calls. She says that they have just been super busy.

Shared they talk often and they are learning together.  Feels pretty confident about this match.  No concerns disclosed.
3628364,"HM apologized for the delay in getting back to me.  Shared that she has had tons of phone troubles (lost her cell, etc.). Shared things are ok.  Shared how she shared her concerns surrounding the need to have a higher level of training in development milestones and child educ options that the AP should offer toddlers/pre-schoolers, etc.. and that she shared with the SFO her concern surrounding the cost of having an AP (when they cause a plumbing issue) and that she was given a financial exception of which she was pleased with.  Shared that things are ok and she feels she basically has a ""babysitter"" not a child care educator of which she feels we should offer."
3628345,"Over all it's ok.  There are times when they think she's just not all there... leaving the slider door unlocked when no one else is home, then saying she didn't know how it worked (she's been there for several months now!).  She is more dependent that others and hangs with the family.  She just bought her own car (against HF's wishes) and she is enjoying her freedom.  Because the HF did not pay for the car or will ever allow their children in the car with the AP, the HF is NOT providing insurance.  They feel the AP is irresponsible enough to never have a working phone, so how is it possible that she can afford or will maintain auto insurance.  They have shared with her the requirements for driving in CA."
3628341,"HM shared that all is well as usual.  Shared that the AP is amazing, wonderful and loving towards her children and can't complain about anything."

3628216,"HM Denise returned AD's call.  Things are ""beautiful"" and they are ""happy as can be"" with Luana.  They are getting ready to go away for a few days to Great Wolf Lodge, and Luana wants to go with them (and they are glad).  Match 100% compliant."
3628213,"Had nice conversation with Sue - she is busy with her play that she is directing, Bill is going to be traveling 4 of the next 6 weeks and the kids all have activities so Clara is going to be kept very busy.  We talked about batch cooking, summer activities etc."
3628212,HM reported all is going well with Khem. She is great with the kids.Driving is good. HM asked me to send the new Thai information who is coming to Rochester in April. HM said some of the AP's from Thailand are nice to her and some ones that stayed in Michigan are not so nice.  I asked HM to encourage Khem to attend more AP meetings as she has missed Feb. and March and only came for 30 mins in January. Next event is in our city of Rochester and near her home.
3628210,HM reported things are going well with Naty. Past AP came back to visit for a few days before she did traveled around the USA.  Nathy is great with the baby and she fits right into their family. They are going away for Easter together and then AP will take vacation time also.
3628206,HM reported things are better with Pati. She seems to be talking more but HM said her English needs to improve. She can't wait for her to start English classes at OCC this spring.

3628188,Everything is going well with the new AP. They are very happy with her.
3628168,"Placement is going much better.  They said that Monica is more helpful and gets along well with the kids.  Christine reported that at first she was not helping with the dishes or cleaning up after herself but, after direction, is much more helpful with the kids around the house. Christine said that Monica has taken a few driving courses but that she needs to check back in with Monica to see how she is doing with that.  She hopes that over the summer, Monica will be ready to drive the kids to summer camp which is only a 5 minute drive."
3628157,Everything going well.  They are still looking for a house in the DC area. He will let me know when they have their new address.  He is thinking it will be in June.
3628150,Really well.  They are planning to extend and I told them the deadline and discussed renewing the Visa/doing it earlier.  Andrea said she is very different than Ariane but still such a great help to the family and wonderful in her own way.  She said they have been so luck with APC.  Going to visit Mike and Cole in Florida this weekend with Isa.
3628144,Spoke with Maureen. Everything is great with Marcella. They are getting into a consistent schedule. She has made some friends and has even gone out on a few dates since she's been here.   They have no real plans for spring break but Maureen and the family may go to Europe over the summer. They have told Marcella she is welcome to come if she would like. AP seems to enjoy her ESL class and is looking forward to starting  CLC in the summer.
3628143,"Sebastian's brother came into town with his mother.  ""They are ""a little weird"", these guys are a little off personality wise, maybe she's shy.""  No initiative in buying food or cooking.  WIth the 2 extra people it would have been nice if they offered to buy food or treat the HF.  They have been home every night for dinner.  It's been a month long thing with visitors.  It is a little stressful and even for Pat who is so easy going.  They are here for another week and then his friends.  They haven't been alone for a month so the HP's left for a date night.  Pat is interested in getting someone new and Patty is interested in staying.  The change is hard on the kids.  Actively doing homework with the children.  He is still clueless about food and cooking and that is difficult for Pat."
3628132,"Babysitter driving with her for the last month.  At first she was having trouble with lane changes and merging and now she has shown improvement.  Hada translated an email to her about her driving skills and her need to practice.  They had a great conversation about driving in Columbia is very different, small car and traffic moves slowly.  She understands that she needs to practice and take it seriously.  Will begun driving next week to LAB.  She has been driving to Leila's school already."
3628131,APO went pretty well. HF really likes Tati. HF speaks French so there is no communication problems. Current AP is training her and showing her around.  Host Children really like her.  She applied for her Social Security number already. She had fun at Whirly Ball an met many friends.  HF reported driving is good and still showing her around.
3628128,really great
3628125,All is good with AP.  HM has taken a new job that is close to home reducing her daily commute by 2 hours.  They are currently determining with her new commute whether or not the will need to host another AP. HM plans to attend monthly event at Schlitterbahn waterpark with AP and HC.  They will arrive early and meet inside.
3628120,HM reports they had a rough 1st weekend.  First the 5 year old who has special needs broke his leg at a trampoline place. He is in a full cast and in a wheel chair.  HM reported she feels bad for Mirna because there is not for her to do with him right now as he only  wants to run around.  They have a wagon for him to pull around the house and looking forward to going outside when it gets nicer.  HM reported he may need surgery. HF going to NY next week for her Brother's wedding. They are not sure what will happen next week with Ben and the wedding.  HM reported the 1st few days Mirna was late for work and looked like she just rolled out of bed in her PJ's. I told HM that I can talk to her about this at the APO which I did. HM reported that next day she was on time and was dressed.  HM reported her English is not that strong but she is a fast learner.
3628119,HM reports all is going well with Petra. She is great with the kids and is doing awesome. HF still undecided if they will continue with program or not. Kids getting older and Petra may stay and get married and work for them.  Will decide in a few months.
3628112,HM says that everything is going fine. Heading into last couple of weeks with Karin. They hope to have another au pair by summer.
3628110,They are doing great - getting ready to extend
3628096,"everything's great - AP already a part of our family - HC love her, she is great with them - all well!  HM offered to host April meeting"
3628094,"HM said they are surviving the mid-March snow.  They have had a couple of bumps, but are all doing ok."
3628093,"All is going well, AP has improved since I had been out for the mediation. Family was on their way to Florida for Spring break. The family was looking forward to this time away."
3628091,Very well.  HM says this is just a great Match.
3628090,"HM said AP can be forgetful, and they have needed to implement a checklist for her to sign off on at the end of each work day.  She said it is frustrating having to remind her of things needing to be done.  However, she did say they still enjoy having her, and may want to extend with her."
3628073,HF just came back from Florida for one week.  HM loves AP and can not believe how great the program is.  HM is telling friends that they should look at an AP with APC due to how much it has improved their lives.
3628071,HF just came back from vacation for spring break with the boys.  AP is going to take two weeks vacation for himself.  AD and HM talked about her plans once this program year is over.  HM is not sure she will get another AP.
3628070,Great Ana is adjusting well to the family
3628069,"HM feels things have improved tremendously. AP gets along very well with the kids and has been able to establish bed time routines which have helped so much.  HM is still under a lot of pressure at work but feels there is a routine at home now, which makes life easier."
3628068,"HD said they are trying to talk AP into extending, and asked if AD would put in a good word for them as well!  They said they have already asked AP, but she has not given them a response yet.  AD will call AP about it today."
3628067,HM said they are looking forward to meeting Gigi's sister in May!  AD told her she thinks it is brilliant that they will have had 3 APs who are all sisters!
3628064,really well Laura loves the family and the court date went very well
3628063,really well Kalsie has totally adjusted and the kids really love her
3628060,"HM said things are going wonderfully with AP.  They love her, and think she is a fabulolus addition to their family.  AD congratulated HM on referring HF Davitch to us, and let her know her referral bonus check is on the way."
3628058,"Melissa was traveling so that is why it was hard to reach her. She says ,All is fine with them, They auto-pay Naty so typically there is no issue with timing.  She is always wonderful and has a much deserved 9 days off starting on Saturday and is headed out to Disney!"
3628049,"Ryan says, Tati is great.  She continues to be loving, patient, and steadfast with the kids.  They are all very happy."
3628040,All is going well. HM apoligized for delay in reply. New cell is 925.203.0867.

3628037,All is going well. They are happy with their AP and program.
3628035,They are doing really good.  Excited for a second year.  Nettie is going home for 2 weeks for her traveling time to see her family.  She is doing great with the boys.
3628034,Great. They are extending for a year and are thrilled.
3628027,Great so far.  Everyone is adjusting well to everyone else and getting used to a new AP.  Kids are doing well getting to know AP.
3628026,"Placement is going well.  Busy family schedule at the moment, but relationship between HF and AP continues to be good.  No issues to report."
3628025,"Good.  HM has been communicating well with the AP and has brought up a few minor issues with the AP, but they seem to be working through it.  AP sometimes makes inappropriate comments of a personal nature around HM and also dresses somewhat provocatively.  HM understands that this is probably mostly a culture difference. AP has expressed interest to the HM regarding staying for a 2nd year."
3628024,Everything is going really well. HF is getting ready to say goodbye to current AP and HF just welcomed their new AP. The family and APs are traveling to San Diego next month.
3628003,HM says that they are well and things are good with AP & Kids.
3627998,going great with Pili. Hayley let me know she is pregnant with a boy due in Aug! Hayley will be off the first couple months and then her husband will be off the 3rd month. Pili will be a big help with the older kids.
3627996,"It is fine, helped her with her taxes- at least May did. (Past AP-they still see) Becky says she has really grown this year, matured and her driving has much more confidence. they are going to extend for the year! Maya wants to go home to see her family and renew her Visa so she will use her 10 days vacation as soon as their son is out of school about the 6th of June. I mentioned Maya should work w/ OS partners to secure her Visa Appointment"
3627987,HF are in the process of completing the extension application. Very happy to be extending as Cicek  does a good job! They are happy.
3627985,"Things are going fine (HM) they are remodeling this summer so will rent a house for two months while going through this, have talked with AP about it"
3627983,HM says the placement is good.
3627982,"Going great, bru is creative and fun with Michaela. Bru drives her to lessons etc. all is good"
3627977,Things continue to go well -
3627972,AP is settling in nicely - looks like it will be a good match
3627966,"HD John and AD have finally made a connection. John shared that all remains the same in their home with Giss. He would like her to be more proactive with obtaining her driver's license as it has now been 6 months since her arrival and AP needs to settle the paperwork necessary with her multiple names on her documents. HF is still not pleased the way this upcoming trip came about, and AP has now used all her vacation time. AD asked about the summer plans with JJ and camp, and where does that put Giss if HC is not going to need care. AD also asked if there is a written schedule so that AP knows her time off. HD said that often AP is given extra time when scheduled when grandparents come over to visit and they dismiss her, which should be a positive factor."
3627957,Pretty well.  Josephina said she's had to talk with Franzi quite a bit in the last few weeks because she's been slacking off.  She is not engaging with the youngest child because he is pretty tough on her.  Josephina is helping Franzi understand that she can't just ignore him or let him slide because he's difficult.  The family is going to Turkey over spring break and Franzi is taking time off then too.  They are not planning to get another au pair once Franzi's year is done.
3627953,"It is awesome.  They love her.  She is so good with the girls and is getting them to do things no one else ahs been able to do.  She is potty training one, baking with them, and giving out stickers for good behavior!  Meagen trusts her with everything - in the home and out of it.  The bad experience was worth it to have such a wonderful time now."
3627951,"Everything is great and they love Adriana. They are already starting to think of what to do when she ends her time in August, and it is good they start now, I am encouraging them to go search early."
3627950,"Spoke with Andria and she says Magda is great, all is good."
3627937,Everything is going well and the HF loves their AP. They don't have any problems or concerns.
3627935,Everything is going fine. AP is great and the kids really like her. They don't have any questions or concerns.
3627933,HM says things are going better with AP now. they are trying to communicate more daily and that seems to be helping
3627927,Everything is going well.  The mother-in-law may be coming in to provide childcare.
3627920,"Good, everything is fine"
3627916,Good. All is well
3627915,HF is doing great.  They are going to take care of their extension application.  HF is happy with their AP and they don't have any concerns.
3627909,"Everything is going great with AP, they all just returned from Disneyland."
3627857,"Hm says things are going well, nothing new to report.  HM has been busy with work"
3627851,"Everything is going great. She likes how independent AP is, feels confident she always knows what to do."
3627846,"HD called me back. Never has much to say, but said things good, haven't discussed extension yet."
3627808,HM had some questions about taxes.
3627790,HD said things are going fine so far from his perspective. AP does not give feedback on what she does or doesn’t like. AP Is doing well and enjoys the HC so far.
3627785,AP is doing well and will be sad to go at the end of her 2nd year. HF has enjoyed the AP and will miss her.
3627782,"HM and AP asked about the agreement and whether or not the HF was responsible to pay for supplies. AD replied that HF does not pay for supplies because the cost of classes exceeds the allowance.  HF had offered to pay for additional classes after AP completed education and HF was frustrated with the AP’s constant demand for more money, more time off, etc. AP asked about extending and HM called AD to discuss this too. AD said AP would need to be open to anywhere in the US, but AP has something specific in mind to be near her boyfriend. AP decided not to extend."
3627773,Spoke with HD who said things were going well. AP is quiet and says things are ok for her. She has struggled with the oldest HC who is very bright and outgoing and the two have different personalities.
3627764,"AP is very happy with the HF. Things have gone well. HM said AP is awesome, easy to get along with and very helpful. She isn’t great at planning activities for the kids, but she does well with the routine and everything else."
3627755,"AP has had a good experience with the HF and is looking forward to completing her experience.  She will miss the HC. HM is nervous about the new arrival and will miss Tanja, but is also looking fwd to a new routine."
3627743,"AP has no concerns. We discussed extending and AP may extend for 9 or 12 months with another family. HF has had a good experience, but HC are older and they do not need an au pair after this year. HM and AP have no current concerns."
3627735,"HM has enjoyed AP, but doesn’t think she will extend. She asked AP for a decision by May. AP has been happy with the HF and all is well, neither have concerns."
3627728,"HM said AP is very indecisive and doesn’t always have follow through. She said she has learned to work with that and instead of giving her too many choices she is more clear on what she needs the AP to do. Oldest HC and AP do not get along, but HM said they have been able to work together. She will find a new AP and hopes to find someone with a stronger but easy going personality. AP has had questions about extending, but inevitably she will not be able to extend. She also asked about the Toefl prep test and AD sent info. AP has been ok with the match,  but not great."
3627721,"HF is working through concerns with AP and said overall things are going well. AP said things are still difficult with the boy, but she said things are going fine overall and the HF is nice. She told me she had resolved all past financial issues. She also asked about the tax form."
3627717,"The HF is still working through the settling in stage with this AP. Overall, things are ok so far. AP is happy with the HF and has a handful of friends in the area."
3627714,HM and AP have no complaints. They both are communicating well and AP is good with the children.
3627712,Hm said they have had a good month.  Hm said she is still trying to get adjusted to her new job.  AP has been an excellent help during the transition.  HF and AP have discussed extending.  HM says AP is torn but said it is a bit easier to find employment during the summer months AP will probably return home.  HM would like to begin search for new AP.  AD will let ME know
3627706,HM has been very pleased with the AP. AP is happy with the family and enjoys the HC. Things are going well for them.
3627700,"HD said all is going well from their side of things, it was a smooth transition. AP said it’s ok, but she would like to be in a family where she could spend more time with the family. HF is very busy with work."
3627681,HM and AP have no complaints. They have had a good year. The previous au pairs were both visiting recently and both stayed with friends part of the time. AP is planning her travel month.
3627672,"Spoke with HD this month and all is well. He said AP has been great, no concerns. AP has done well. She is looking forward to returning home at the end of the program year because she misses her family and her sister just had her first baby."
3627666,"Good, HM said Sina's boyfriend is in town and they went to Niagra Falls for a few days.  HM wanted to know if there are other male AP's in the area and I said yes, one in Mequon."
3627661,AP and HM have no concerns to report. AP asked about class options and will start class in april. Hm is glad AP is settling in and things are going well.
3627657,All great with new AP - fits right into the family and is wonderful with HC - HC loves her - all well
3627654,"AP went to a dentist for concerns about her gum, the dentist said it was normal because of her wisdom teeth and she will need to have them removed when she returns home. Otherwise, AP is happy. She will travel with a friend and then return home after the program year. HM and I discussed candidates and they selected a new AP arrival for July.  HM said things are going well. Alice has been a good au pair and things are going well."
3627651,Great - everything still wonderful with outgoing AP and HF delighted with their new match (AD's recommendation!)  all well
3627645,"Not great.  AD spoke with HM when she was on her way to court for a ticket she received when AP passed a school bus - the bus driver took down the license plate and reported it to police - as such, HM, not AP, received ticket - AD told HM to make sure court knew AP was the driver, etc.  HM very upset.  AD told HM to let her know what happened at court and that AP was responsible for the charges"
3627641,"Everything great with AP - HC loves her, she's a quick learner and seems to take her responsibilities very seriously.  All well"
3627637,"HF has abruptly decided to end the match.  HM states the reason is that HF doesn't need 2 AP's - that needs more of an Executive Assistant.  HM will not discuss further.  AD has requested a meeting, and a conversation so if there's more to it, AP can learn for her next placement.  AD still waiting."
3627630,"Everything great with AP - good with HC, a great addition to their family vacation in Florida, happy, bubbly, positive, etc.  All well.  HM worries that AP doesn't make friends easily and asked AD's help.  AD agreed that AP has met a lot of other AP's but no continuing friendships have developed.  AD will continue to offer assistance with this."
3627629,Kyah said everything is good. She said she had a day last week where she was doubting if it was going to work because Haven was pushing back against Yui since she didn't understand her.  Kyah said she prayed about it and later that day when she returned Haven and Yui were playing so well together and things have been great ever since.
3627594,HD reports that everything is good.  Same as last month.  No questions.
3627590,"HM updated AD on APs trip out west.  AP returned home safely on Sunday.  AP told HM he lost his phone and was frustrated about losing his phone so he punched a wall/glass plate and cut his arm.  He had to go to the hospital because the cut needed stitches HM is not sure where AP punched wall but he did not get a citation etc. AD said she will speak to AP to see if she can get more of the story...where this happened, etc. AP will need help getting reimbursed for medical bills and so more details about the situation will come out.  AD asked HM if she is OK with this frustration.  HM said in the 7 months hosting AP she has not seen this type of behavior.  HM believes this was a one time incident.  HM and AD agreed to continue to talk to AP.  AD agreed to help AP file for reimbursement when medical bills arrive HM said in spite of this accident AP had a good time on vacation"
3627577,AP is great.   AP i Mexico.  Hf going to Costa Rica for one week at time share HF ready for vacation and warm weather
3627574,Things are going very well.  HM is much more relaxed now and comfortable and really feels Tatiane was a good choice.
3627563,"All is going well so far. AP was sick for a few days, but doing better now.  Confirmed meeting for Friday. All is well and Caroline seems to be a good fit so far."
3627551,Things are going very well.  HM is really happy with AP and is hoping she extends for a year but will see how long the AP is willing to stay.  We discussed extension options and I need to send her some paperwork for her to look over.
3627544,finally got HM on her cell on her way to work. She first stated that she didn't have much time. HM still has concerns about Annika. Annika continues to be very rigid and strict with the children. She has a hard time incorporating the HF's way of disciplining and has a tendency to use her own rules and opinions. She will argue with the HM when the HM points out to her if she wants things done in a different way. They continue to have the bi weekly meeting and it seems helpful. They are planning another meeting Friday and will let me know how it goes next week
3627532,Going very well. See below.
3627527,Great.  HM said family will be very sad to see Camila go in June.
3627515,"Very well.  HM said everything is just great and apologized for taking so long to get back to me, the HF has been very busy lately."
3627514,"Very well.  HM said everything is just great and apologized for taking so long to get back to me, the HF has been very busy lately."
3627511,Things are ok.  AP tries with HC.  HF wants AP to speak all the time in Chinese to HC but he does not understand Chinese
3627497,Good no complaints
3627495,Very good.  HM is pleased with AP's job with babies and helping out
3627488,"Spoke with Gitte.  All is great with Jeruscha.  She thinks that Jeruscha hits it out of the park.  Asked her if she plans on getting another AP. She said that she is still a bit gun shy about getting another AP, due to their first one -- but her husband is more open to another au pair.   They are going away alot over the summer so it would be that they would need a new AP in late August or early September. They probably would go for a self extender again and we talked about the timing of getting a self-extender."
3627487,Good. We have good communication and talk about any issues/ concerns with the AP.  HF is happy AP is extending
3627483,Very Well.  HF is very happy.
3627476,Spoke with Cynthia. She said that things are ok with Bruna. Communication has improved between them but she lacks confidence in her. She is hoping that things continue to stay status quo until July. Cynthia has been very involved with volunteer work and hasn't had time to look for a new ap yet. She is hoping to start her search soon.
3627457,"Hmom reports that AP Klara is doing wonderfully, mom says out of everyone in the family, Klara is the most excited to go to Hawaii with them over their spring break. Hmom reports that AP Klara has made many new AP friends since taking her class at oakton. Mom loves that Klara has invited her friends over to the house to watch a movie. Mom thinks it's great  for her kids to be exposed to all the other cultures of APs friends."
3627456,HF states everything is going well with AP.  HF is unsure about another AP as the HD is currently deciding on an offer to relocate with his employer to Saudi Arabia. They will be able to consider hosting another AP more once they have made this decision.  HM said that they have told AP that she needs to study the driving laws in Texas and take the exam for her learners permit. They feel that they have put the ball in her court and if she is ready to go get her learners permit she needs to notify them.
3627432,Very well.
3627431,Everything is good. They do have a concern.  Rose is planning on getting married - they don't know when.  The man is from her city in China and they  knew each other before she came here.  They think she came as an AP only as   way to et into the country. They foolishly allowed her to take all of her vacation before she had earned it to visit him in NYC.  She is happy in front of the family and puts on a good face.  She is on the phone constantly.   Or texting.  She doesn't talk about him at all.  they know that his mother wants them to get married.   Rose is also looking into getting a student visa and what is required to do so.  Dorothy wonders what will be the penalty for the family if she leaves all of  sudden.  Dorothy has learned much of this information from a friend who is also a friend of Rose..  Dorothy has resumed her AP search in FR.
3627428,Spoke with Amy. She said that things were great with Rimi and Victoria. They are getting ready for their big trip to China in a month or so. Amy has started looking for her next ap. She emailed someone who never got back to her. She said that she hasn't interviewed anyone yet but intends to start and that Charlotte is helping her.
3627422,Spoke with Ginny. She said that things are going fine with Gabriela. The kids are doing well and like her. She said there is not much else to report. She will take her vacation in May.
3627417,Good.  HF is happy to have matched with new AP and to be done interviewing
3627401,"AP just arrived, is very quiet, but o far going well. HF and AP are settling in."
3627398,"Hmom reports that all is good with AP Adela, mom says Adela is leaving to go to Jamaiica on saturday for a week with some other friends. Mom is a little worried because the girls are staying in Hostels while they are there.  I told Hmom to make sure she discusses the importance of safety with AP before AP leaves.  Hmom had questions about extending with AP, I told Hmom their Ext. deadline is Aug1st.  Explained the process of AP renewing her visa also. Hmom said they will be taking AP with them to Fla. over their spring break in April over Easter."
3627397,"IT is going just great.  They had a big weekend as it was the girls' birthday.  They had a  party at school on Friday.  On Saturday, they had family and a few friends.  Other wise all is going  well.  Jessica is going to take a French class next. They are planning a trip in July."
3627393,All is well and no complaints from HM or AP; HF will begin their search for a new AP.
3627390,HM said things are great. They are very happy with nerea. They would be interested in extending. Nerea went to NY for vacation a few weeks ago. She met her boyfriend there. She is undecided about extending. She is now driving the kids and the HF added her to the insurance and will pay for the insurance. They resolved that concern.
3627388,I spoke to Eileen and she said they are doing well.  She said they are all set for the extension for Yudy and she is looking forward to going home for a few weeks.  She said they were out of town for the weekend and didn't get back in time for the aupair meeting. I told her when the next aupair meeting is.
3627383,"HM was in a meeting, but she said all was going well so far. AP has no concerns. She asked about driver’s license since the cost was 10 more than any other ap had paid in 2013."
3627369,AP had questions about leaving early to start a new job by  August 1st in Germany. She will discuss with HM. HM is searching for a new AP. HM said AP Is good with HC even though they wish she would go out more and enjoy the experience.
3627365,Things are going well. AP is having a hard time with the weather here and doesn't really like it. She might extend for a second year in a new place. We discussed ideas for overcoming the constant cloudiness. She is probably going with the HF to San Diego or So Cal or spring break. HF is very happy with her and they have a good relationship.
3627345,"IT is okay.  Mako came back from Japan feeling good and things have been going smoothly.  Except hey caught he smoking again - in the house.  So they had a talk and she agreed to change.  I suggested that if she doesn't do so, they should give her a consequence.  She is doing well with the boys."
3627322,"HD said AP is doing well, and is in the groove now.  He said they have overcome the car accident incident, and have had no issues since."
3627285,"HM shared that things were going well as usual.  Shared how she would miss Jelena alot, especially Zoe.  AD shared how she should reapply now to gain access to FR and get to interview the Serbian in Westchester before someone scoops her up.  HM said she would.  No concerns."
3627272,"HF reports that AP seems to be adjusting to their family and her childcare responsibilities.  She is quickly learning her way around town.  Hf reports that she has made a couple of new friends that she  does things with.  HF reports that AP has not decided on classes yet but is looking.  Hdad has decided that it is necessary for him to quit his job and be a stay home parent (this is for older son's sake)  Current nanny -Maggie will be leaving soon. Despite these recent changes,  All seems to be running smoothly."
3627269,HM called to reschedule HFI.  Now scheduled for Sunday.  Things are going well according to HM and she thinks AP will fit nicely into their family.  Old AP leaves on Friday and they are sad to see her go.
3627262,All is well. Shared the HM.   AD congratulated HM  on their recent match.  HM shared they were excited and at least pleased it one less thing they have to worry about.  No concerns.
3627260,Spoke with Ashlee.   She said all is going great with Diana.  She said that Diana is going to extend for sure. I gave her the deadline of July 1st.   Wanted to know how Diana could become a US citizen.  I explained that I was not an expert in this area and that Diana should contact an immigration attorney.
3627259,HM said they are in Disneyworld during spring break with AP.  They are doing great!  They can't believe AP's time is coming to a close.
3627241,"HM shared that things are awesome as usual.  No complaints and if there was she disclosed she would be shocked, she joked."
3627232,HM shared that they are working together as best as possible.  She is learning and they are hoping that as time goes on her Eng improves.  No concerns to spk of.
3627227,HM is generally happy with AP. They will be in Mexico over spring break. AP Is happy and things are going well.
3627218,All is well. HM asked about AP traveling to Mexico and AD provided info on travel in the 2nd year.  AD told them there is a risk associated and that it hasn’t been a problem. HM asked I would let my own extension au pair go and AD replied yes. AP will travel with another AP and her family to Mexico. AP is happy with the family and there are no complaints. HM also clarified two weeks of vacation and up to $500 for a 9 month extension AP education
3627210,HM has no complaints. She requested AP’s last working date before she extends with another family. AD met AP to review education documents and discuss extension. AP is very happy with the family and still working on driving.
3627204,All is well. HF is happy with AP and she gets alone well with the family
3627200,
3627170,"Hmom says things are good with Jessi, she was not as forthcoming with me as she usually is when talking on the phone, I'm wondering if it's because she is still upset with APC that we would not give her a refund for her AP Jessi's early departure?  Mom had a few questions about Jessi's return, eg. what day, and time etc... I told Hmom that APC will send Jessi Return Flight inof in which she'll choose her top 3 picks.  Mom says their construction on their home should be done within the next 3 weeks or so. Mom reports that Jessi has been very patient during it all.  Mom says Jessi's Boyfriend is coming to visit in April, they will spend their time together in L.A."
3627162,"Anne called me back and thanked me for my call. She said that nothing is new from the last time we spoke a few weeks ago. All is going well with Marion and she has ""hit her stride.""  Marion is going on vacation in a couple of weeks with an out-of-town friend.  All good with all."
3627142,"I spoke with Carla. All is good with Brenda, except she failed her practical driving test.  Carla does not need her to drive but it would be a ""nice to have.""   Carla thinks that a lot of au pairs from latin countries just can't drive.  In general, Carla is doing well. They finished their house remodel but they found mold under all the flooring, so they are going to have to move out again and what a mess it will be. Carla saddened by this turn of events as she doesn't feel she has been able to settle down here."
3627096,Well.  Called Charles and then Wei.  Wei just returned from China and she said the girls are doing well.  She was sleeping at 2 pm since she just got back in the country.
3627083,I spoke with Elisa.  She said that all is going great with Celine. They are really happy with her. She thanked me for my call.  She was really busy and could not talk long.
3627081,"Really well.  It's been a lot easier than it was when she had her son.  She doesn't know how people have two kids under 2 without an au pair.  She is so helpful, helps them keep up with laundry and dishes, which is so hard when you have a newborn attached to you.  She has bonded well with Felix and is very attuned to him.  Hm often asks her what he wants or needs because she knows Katerina knows.  He is not suffering having a sibling because she is always there to read to him or play with him and he still gets lots of attention.  Other friends text Katarina too about things they want to do, go on a walk or bring dinner and Katerina relays the messages.  She is like a personal assistant for all things family.  She fits so well into the family and is has been so enjoyable.  She is really glad they made this decision.  Everyone has a little cold but otherwise they are great."
3627078,"Everyone is well at home.  He stated that Roxy didn't hang out with them the past day or so and they hope that she is ok and not bothered by anything.  I stated that he has to remember that they have multiple components family at home, Host Family and friends.  Emotionally it can be a lot to manage and she may just need a little space.  I shared that they can always ask her and he stated that he was going to have Caitlin check in because they are very close. I called Roxy ad she stated that she is great, but trying to figure out some school options."
3627064,"Hmom reports that all is good with AP Courtney, mom said she kind of forced Courtney to come to our ""Whirly Ball activity and when Courtney returned home, she told mom how much fun she had and was glad she went. Mom says AP is getting very excited to go home in May.  Hmom, son and AP will be going to Kansas city over Spring Break to visit Family.  All is well."
3627061,"HM shared that all is well as usual.  Shared that they were all looking forward to a great Spring break vaca.  No concerns to spk of.  The kids still love her and so do we, giggled the HM."
3627057,Marcie excited to have matched. She was REALLY appreciative that APC decided to purchase a ticket for Katherine's departure back to Korea.   She said it meant so much to Katherine.
3627052,great-- excited to head to Disneyworld next week.  Erla is great and really is a good fit for the family.  We discussed extension and the deadlines involved.  She wants AP to decide by June so that family can receive early discount if she decides to go home.
3627047,"well.  Yesterday she texted asking if she could go to the mall with our child, to meet another AP.  We said yes, assuming it was the mall 5 miles from the house.  Later she said she was at a different mall…about 20 miles from the house.  HD responded that she should be more clear in the future.  AP responded she was at the mall close to the house, and that she was just joking.  HD was disturbed and asked why would she ever joke about something like that, it's important to the dad to know where his child is at all times.  AP replied that in Columbia young people test their parents all the time.  AP returned from mall and went straight to bed, so they haven't had a chance to talk further yet.  HD going to talk to her tonight."
3627045,"I spoke with David. All things are wonderful with Gaetan.  David needed our tax ID number and I gave it to him. Also, needed APC's address and an invoice. I let him know I would get the invoice sent to him."
3627029,"HM shared things are ok.  Feels she is coming along, Eng improving and they are all trying to work together.  Shared how she is sensitive to culture and knows things take time (Eng understanding) and they are helping each other.  Shared the AP is a sweet girl.  No concerns."
3626995,"very good, the children just adore her, and I appreciate how dependable she is."
3626989,"great!  AP has made more friends, and seems happier.  She is a part of our family and we are loving having her."
3626980,very good.  AP does a great job
3626975,"good, no problems.  Not sure we'll match again after Alana leaves.  The kids are going to school, so needs are less."
3626968,Talked to HF they are all really happy with Chloe's arrival. They have been adjusting well. Phoebe the younger child had a really good transitions from Aude to Chloe. HF asked AD to give AP extra attention since she seems to be homesick.
3626967,Well.  HM and Lara are in CO having Lara's tests for her colon and she had to have surgery.
3626958,"Really well. Simona is calm, patient, the girls love her and they love her too.  Even her husband feels the same way.  They trust her and she does what they tell her the first time they tell her it.  She is self-aware and great with the kids.  She does her own thing and is conscious of her space, time off and time with the kids.  She got her license and is relieved about that.  She studied and put pressure on herself and now doesn't want to take classes.  Discussed deadlines for extending and not putting it off until the last minute.  Discussed not missing activities every time and I will send the plans for several months in advance."
3626910,HF loves AP and is very excited that she is with them.
3626905,HM apologized for not calling back sooner. HM stated that she was at an all week work event last week. HM said that things are going well.
3626899,"HM said that AP does a great job with HC, but AP got into another car accident and HM is worried because AP feels very bad about it. HM said that they understand, but wanted AD to check in with AP again."

3626833,All is good with them and Amila.  This the first time!
3626801,Things are going well.  No big changes.  Work is still being done on the house. HM and I did discuss next year and the discount if she matches early.  She does plan to have another AP and will look into reapplying.
3626794,Good.  HM sais overall things are fine.  Though she still has some concerns with the APs level of maturity and lack of mature thought processes as well as responsibility.  The kids love her though and she is very easy going and easy to talk to.
3626792,AP has applied for SS# and is studying for DL test AP says she is adjusting well to new HF and home.  AP says another AP has been helping her get familiar with the area AD is sorry AP missed March social and hopes AP will attend the April social
3626708,"Let HM know extension is due July 1.  See if there is anything we need to do to prepare for it, AP going to Brazil, etc.  Ap plans to renew Visa but not sure when yet.  Classes will finish in May and will extend.  AP has the extension document I gave her in the APO."
3626690,Good
3626685,Good
3626683,Sheryl was difficult to get in touch with this month for some reason.  She did warn me that March and April would be tough for their family because its tax season.  Sheryl did say that Katrin has decided not to extend with them so the family is now searching for her replacement.  The matching expert is helping them by adding au pair profiles directly to their family room which is helpful.
3626680,Everything is fine with Vivian
3626675,Good ap is now in 2nd year
3626673,Great we love Renata and plan to extend
3626671,Things are going well.  HM asked about AP making contacts with other APs.  AD told HM she had given AP's name to another AP and sent an email to AP and Michelle so hopefully they can connect as well.
3626662,"Things are going great. Away on business, but Bruna is there til Sunday and is showing Astrid around and exactly what needs doing with all the childcare duties."
3626648,"AP spoke to HD.  HD had questions about taxes and AP answered and sent tax document.  HD said AP has been a great addition to the family.  With both parents having careers that are very demanding it is nice to have another ""family"" member to help raise the kids.   HD is glad HM and HD get to spend some time together while AP takes care of the kids too"
3626641,Good. AP is very sweet and excellent with baby.  Older girls still adjusting to AP
3626640,Very good.  AP does a good job.  HF is unsure if they want another AP.  HF is also considering moving to Tennessee
3626621,"Very well.  Teresa and I had a long chat about Bruna and how things are going.  The family is very happy with her.  Katie has been having a bit of a hard time lately.  Right now she's ill with strep throat so she's giving Bruna a hard time.  Teresa is trying to help Bruna by giving her ideas on how to see when Katie is just not feeling well and when she's being a little manipulative.  Overall, things are great.  Bruna does need to get back into studying her english and she will find a class soon.  Teresa says she's a lot like her - serious and logical.  Dave is the softie!"
3626620,HM and I spoke a couple of times this month. I told her how to reapply.  HM asked me why AuPairCare has not sent the return flight process yet as I told her it was going to be down manually since Louise was leaving early but since Louise is going to request her flight after July 15th there is no reason to do it early.  Louise will travel her last couple of weeks for vacation.  They continue to struggle with little things but seem to either let it go or ignore it.
3626618,HM and I spoke about Jeni leaving Early and the new AP coming in. There will be a 1 month gap. HM has family coming in to help.  They reported next AP got her VISA already and they talk to her 2-3 times per week.  HM said Jeni has been very helpful over the past few months.
3626617,Great everything is going really well.
3626616,HM stated everything is great! HM was on vacation without HC! AP and HM's mom stayed home with HC. AP kept regular schedule while HM was away.  AP and HM's mom get along really well -- they are FB friends!
3626614,HM reported all is well with Genny. HM has no issues or concerns that needs my help. Kids are busy with trying out for Spring Hockey.  Genny was good with the end of the year winter hockey with so many tournaments and games.  HM considering asking her to extend.
3626612,HM reports all is going well with Aby.  The kids really like her and the host family will be sad when she leaves. They report their last AP will come back for a couple of months this summer to help the HF out.  HM reports that Aby can be sometimes forgetful with starting dinner with the kids. HM thought it was nice she wanted to bring them to the Whirly Ball event.
3626611,Very good.  HF is pleased with AP.  HF will be moving in July and has matched with a new AP
3626609,"HM very happy with Paola. She will go back to Paraguay to visit her family for 10 days in June. HM reports she is so nice, sweet and responsible.  The kids really like her and respect her. No concerns or issues."

Encouraged Morgen to talk with Angel about her next class. They will look at a spring course at DCCC or a weekend class.
3626596,"Good, HF is looking for a gift, or something to do for Laras departure, they are worried about the impact on HC and are really sad to see her go."
3626595,"Great, HF is excited about new AP. Current Ap is excellent, still the favorites of all of thier APs."
3626580,"Good.  HM said they are very happy with their AP, she is just a part of the family now."
3626576,Good.  HM said all is well.  They want to travel to Canada over the summer so asked if the AP is limited tothe number of times she can leave the US and get back in.
3626573,Good.  HM said all is well.  She and her husband are traveling in CA and the children are at their grandparent's house.
3626569,Good.  HM said everything is good.  They were very happy that their AP finally went out two nights in a row for the first time.
3626556,"Mina is attending ESL classes at City college regularly, gets paid every Friday, is working < or = to 45 hours per week, and has at least 1 weekend off per month.  She recently got her California Drivers license as well. She'll be going with them for part of the kids' Spring break vacation next week."
3626554,fine
3626546,HM reports all is well with AP.  Everything is going smoothly. HM was very helpful in agreeing that AP will have Sunday free for monthly event and does not mind other APs traveling in their car to event.
3626539,I spoke with the HM about a few concerns. They are still having some issues with the Au pair and the thermostate in her apartment. They have asked her to leave the temp set at 70 but have repeatly seen set as high as 80. The bills are getting very large. They also had some issues with the au pair taking things into her apartment without asking. we talked about her sitting down with the au pair and doing a recap of the last year and reset expectations for the extension year. The thermostate and letting the family know when she needs things. The Au pair is also scheduled to take her DL test in april
3626538,Great!  HF absolutely adores new AP!  HM is pregnant (due in Sept) - so a little morning sickness but still busy and active and happy - all well!
3626536,HM shared that she is thrilled to have AP as part of the family.  Shared the experience has been great with her and her daughter really has gotten close to her.  She shared how it really couldnt get better (the experience) No concerns at all.
3626534,"Things are going well, AP just got her DL."
3626533,"Spoke with Venus a few times this month.  Earlier in the month there had been an incident when AP was watching the kids on her own.  The daughter was bouncing on her bed with AP in the room.  She fell off the bed and bumped her head.  She was fine but had a big bump for a few days.  They had a talk with Carina a few days after it happened about understanding that we can't stop every thing that could happen to the kids, but we need to make the right judgment calls when they are doing things that could end up hurting them. Per HM, things have been much better since. Carina is now on her big trip with her BF from Germany. They are in San Francisco and doing a whole West Coast tour. The family is leaving for Disney World next week. Things are good for now will check in again next month"
3626532,"HF loves Biance, they will be moving over the summer to NYC and will not be able to accommodate an AP..AD spoke to HD about upcoming release date and he will get back to AD."
3626524,"AD spoke with HM, things continue to go well. HM does not understand why the ap can. to pass the NJ driving test. AD suggested HM review the book with her, but HM said she is busy when she is home and doesn't think she can do that."
3626522,"AD spike with HD. He says things are going well. He says they talked about ap being more attentive and ap seems to have made positive changes. HD also asked that ap speak more Japanese with the host children. Currently, AP is on vacation. Grandparents are there to care for children."
3626520,"AD spoke with Matt on 3/18 before they left for Hawaii. They have some concerns with Beatriz just because she seems to have somewhat of a sense of entitlement in regards to her schedule. She is a good worker and is always on time and does a great job when she's working, but tends to complain about the times that she is scheduled.  Per Matt they are very careful as to stay within the required hours. For their trip to Hawaii, Lisa's parents are coming to stay at the house as well as a friend of Lisa's will come and stay overnight for most of the nights that they will be gone. They are going to be very diligent about writing the schedule so that AP gets the required time off. Matt will let me know if he would like me to get more involved. He thinks things will be okay"
3626519,All is good.  HM busy with work.  AP is back and definitely wants to extend. Is not going to renew visa as she does not need to travel back to SA during extension year. Aware of 7/1 deadline for ext. app.
3626515,Spoke with Heather. Alina had left that day for for trip to California with her brother from Germany. She was late to get to the airport because of the weather so she had to switch to a later flight. All is well. They are going to be able to manage just fine without her for a few weeks but will really miss having her around. HM was very happy that AP signed up for that class in Chicago in April. We discussed that another AP is doing it as well and maybe they can room together.
3626496,Dina says things continue to be going well with Cibele. Nothing new to report. They will miss her.
3626494,"HM said all is well, except for the darn snow!  Their year is drawing to a close."
3626493,So far Stephanie says things are ok. She has spoken with Ornella about her concerns and is making some changes. They cleaned up together and Ornella mentioned hiring a cleaning lady if Steph would rather not clean up the house. Ornella seems organized and Steph  and her will work together to better the house and help the  girls be more organized.
3626492,Things are going great! No issues to report. They are busy preparing for more Cheerleading events for host child.
3626491,"Michelle says that things are going fine, she has no issues to report. She's been very busy working night shift, and sleeping during her days. She did take some time off and spent Spring Break with Simona and her daughter."
3626488,"HM said Flavia is doing great, and that she has formed a super relationship with the kids and taken a role as part of their family.  She likes that she is talkative, and also makes an effort to be part of the family in her off hours.  HM's sister got married last week, so AP accompanied them to NYC for the wedding festivities.  AP is planning to take all weekend classes for her education, and should be finished by May."
3626485,"HM said they are all doing well, and that the boys love and adore Ana.  She said she and her husband are very happy with the match."
3626481,"HM said all is going well.  She said they don't see AP as often now, because she is trying to pack as much in as possible before the year ends."
3626471,AD spoke with HM Tierney on 3/5. All is going well with Lais. They have joined a yoga class that is enjoyable after a busy day with the children. AP seems to enjoy hanging out with the family in her off time. AP does have 2 close friends stay over and they are all welcome in the home as they are sweet. HF enjoyed a birthday celebration for Greg and her son this month.
3626467,They are doing well.  Really busy as they are in the thick of sports with the kids.  Ana is working on her English and trying to get signed up for classes.  They are not going anywhere for Spring Break.    Bummed she cannot make it to our event this week as she is working.
3626464,"AD spoke with HM Laurie on 3/7. All is great with Ilona. They will miss her terribly at the end of the month when she goes on vacation. All is wonderful as always, nothing but good things to say about AP. The girls are busy with spring sports and activities at school."
3626458,"Not great- talked about options where Milu either 1- left early or 2- rematched with another family.  As far as # 1 goes- Milu's end date is August 12th.  If you were to fill out an early departure form for Milu (and she was finished with and turned in her completed course form), she would get a completion certificate and AupairCare would purchase her a ticket home.  You would forfeit the remaining months and not receive a credit.  The end date for Milu can be discussed further.  I understand that you plan to leave the program and travel starting this summer.  Option # 2 is if Milu has completed her course work and has her course form signed, she can apply to self-extend.  (An application and a $367 non-refundable extension fee) This means that she could rematch with a new family and have  her remaining time on her original program year plus 6, 9 or 12 additional months available.  The downside to this is if Milu fails to rematch, she would need to purchase her own ticket home, and would be unable to extend.  You would receive a credit for her unused time (assuming she rematches before August 12) and that credit would be good for up to a year in case you returned from traveling and wanted to try again.  (We could extend that year by a few months if you think that would be a good option).  With either option, the sooner she turns in her completed course form the better."
3626457,"They are very happy.  Things have started off great.  William is really happy and getting along famously with Juliane.  Juliane is also spending time with new friends, some of them are in our group. Excited to see her this weekend."
3626450,HM Alyson returned my call on 3/10. She is pleased that Michelle is picking up quickly and her English is also improving. Danni and her are developing a nice bond and that is important to the HF. No concerns.
3626449,Sandra is doing better. They took her to Universal Studios for her birthday last weekend. They are happy and think she is a sweet girl.
3626444,"AD spoke with AP on 3/6. Beata said that AP is learning, but that she is still assisting with the boys and their travels to school as AP did not pass her driver's test. Baby is due end of March. No other concerns, AP seems to be enjoying time with friends, but HM would like her to connect with others as well."
3626441,Barry called to say he is very happy with Angelica. She is very sweet and they are getting along great. Looking forward to having her another year.
3626434,HM said AP is good.  Her boyfriend is in town this week and she is taking a few days off to tour Chicago with him during the day.  She went with them to St. John's and they had a nice time.  Kids are back in school.
3626433,"AP is doing ""wonderful"" and they are very happy.  She is very attentive to the children and spends a lot of her free time with the HF too."
3626429,"OK- Martin is having a hard time with discipline with the boys. Also, because the host mom is at home a lot doing her studying upstairs, they run to her if they disagree with him so he feels a bit undermined. She tries to support him but it is a tough arrangement."
3626428,AD spoke with HD on 3/10. All is going well with AP. The girls love Kate. Kate seems happy and is adjusting. Kate has gone to NYC and spends time with Katerina from Totowa.
3626424,AD spoke with both HM and AP on 3/14. AP had been with HM's mom taking care of the twins. She is learning but waits to be directed at times. HM thinks this may be as she was away and AP did not want to step out of grandmom's childcare. HF and AP are still adjusting but having talks often and they feel this may work out. HF has listened to AP's requests to have time off to be social with other AP's and nannies locally. HF enjoyed their trip to Disney with the older twins.
3626423,HM said things are going fine.  AP speaks English well and is with them this week in Miami for spring break.  We discussed potential APO dates for next week and she said she will get back to me this weekend to confirm.
3626417,HM said things are fine.  She had a couple of questions about AP filing taxes.  I let her know that I emailed out information to the au pair group early February for them to refer to and i could not provide tax advice beyond what was stated in that email.
3626416,"AD spoke with HM Marissa. All is well. Anja was on vacation and they had the assistance of her in laws to help with the children. HF is seeking a new AP as they are not yet sure of Anja's decision to extend or not, and want to be prepared and take advantage of program specials."
3626415,Amanda is making her return flight plans.  She will be leaving her program year early as their new nanny starts at the beginning of summer.
3626413,HM said AP is doing great and they'll likely extend with her for another year.
3626411,"HD said all is fine with AP.  They are looking forward to her attending ESL this Spring as her English is still rough. Aside from that, all is fine."
3626410,"AD spoke with HM Michele early in the month. HM was going to begin selections should AP Rosie not extend. HM stated that she does not want to wait and not have enough time for the early match. HM shared that Rosie did not want to remain in the program, but after much thought she has opted to continue with the family in a 6 month extension. HF is pleased, but wants Rosie to remain upbeat throughout the remaining months. HF will select early for AP#2 as Michele will be in her busiest season upon the departure of Rosie early next year."
3626409,"They are thrilled that through Natalia's help, Jeffrey is now potty trained.  She was instrumental in this and they are forever grateful to her.  Natalia is a huge help around the house and Julie appreciates her willingness to help.  I checked to make sure that Natalia is getting the appropriate time off and not doing housework outside program rules without betraying Natalia's request to let her handle her concerns.  They want to start looking for Natalia's replacement within the next month or so because they want to take their time and not be rushed."
3626407,"HM said they are not looking forward to AP's departure next month.  They've decided that they'll try to find a local nanny as they had a really bad experience with their first AP and it took a while to find Eldaf.  Plus, more importantly, they feel the transition will be too hard on the kids especially since there's so much uncertainty with matching with another great AP and if she would extend or not. They believe a local nanny can commit for a longer term and still be available for visits with the children even after their not their nanny."
3626406,AD spoke with HM early in the month. AP is doing well and Kyle is enjoying their relationship. Bettina is happy with the program and has no concerns. HM is happy so see AP meeting with new and old friends in the area.
3626402,AD spoke with HM Christine on 3/10. Discussions regarding the extension process were reviewed. AD reminded the HF of the deadline date of 5/1. Christine stated the AP Priscilia may now not desire to return home during the holidays as she understands this is not possible. All is well with the girls and AP.
3626394,"Matthew and Sae were on vacation and have returned- are sad that they can't keep Raquel longer, but she's got to be back by June for her scholarship.  Looking for a new AP."
3626389,Thingsa re going well with Macela. Talked about her being homesick and needing to feel more part of the family. Host family going to Nepal at the end of the week.
3626383,"Hendrik says all is well- Lina's Mom, boyfriend and another friend are in town and are helping Hendrik with some renovations upstairs.  Annelise and Jovanna are headed to school in the fall- Lina is indecisive about whether she will extend or not, they will discuss soon.  KNow that the shortest amount she can extend for is 6 months."
3626381,Hm called to ask about the medical insurance. Explained Ap has to call UHC again and tell them to change the code. All is going well otherwise.
3626379,Well- not sure if Carol will extend- will start discussing with her. All is well. Glad to hear a new family is moving to Lithia in May

3626348,good
3626347,"so far, so good."
3626346,"AD spoke to HM Kristin briefly. She has been very busy with interviewing with many new prospective companies to make a change. HF has been interviewing with Lucie and will be set to request a match in the coming days. Andy has been great, and is planning for her trip to Mexico with her local AP friends on 3/29."
3626345,Everything is fine nothing new to report
3626344,"All is ok. Her family is visiting, so HM seemed a bit stressed out."
3626343,Everything is fine.
3626341,Spoke to Mark and things are much better
3626340,AD spoke with HM Jessica on 3/10. All continues to be well with Ana. She is friendly and the family enjoys her as part of their family.
3626329,great
3626326,"HM and I connected a few times, she had heard rumors on how a family had issues with an AP and I calmed her and told her that the rumors often get blown up an dare not as bad as they sound most of the time. Busi is doing a lot better and they feel calmer about her, her driving is much better and all that is good. She is taking good care of the kids. they want to extend but they are also considering someone different for next time. Busi is very sweet but does not always take initiative."
3626322,They are having some communication issues between HD and Pao. They feel like she is uncomfortable with the HD and won't look him in the eye and has some passive/aggressive behavior. They are concerned about this. They want to talk to her first and get back to AD to report if it helped at all.
3626320,Ramee and Joe are very happy with Lisa.  Off to a great start .  SHe attended the ap meeting last week and likes the ap around the corner. NO complaints.  land Line 1 732-369 6025 at the house.
3626317,Everything is fine.
3626316,called Brett
3626315,Everything is going great. They have smiles all around!
3626314,Christina says that Bruna is off to a great start.  She is connecting well with Nicholas and finding friends as well.  So far so good.
3626290,"AD has been in touch with HM while on vacation as well as today, 3/25. Taty is very welcomed by the children, especially the girls who have her playing often. The boys too, are warming up with their new AP. HM has asked about taking Taty with them on a vacation cruise next month. AD discussed protocol with finding out about necessary documentation with the embassy of each country visiting and also suggested calling the cruise line to explain their situation. AO is scheduled for Saturday, 3/29 9am."
3626283,Overall good.  HF is ready for a change.  AP is nice but very forgetful
3626282,Good. HD is very happy with AP and now starting his search for a new AP.  HD is unhappy with how the local police have been treating his AP and he will be going to court to fight a ticket
3626279,Very good.  HM and I spoke about next AP coming.  HM is sad that she is not able to overlap the 2 au pairs due to timing
3626278,AP is wonderful.  Sad to see her leaving soon.  We spoke about selecting next AP.  HM is nervous about making a poor choice
3626268,"Rachel called me. She thinks Diana may be depressed. She was sick for two weeks. She had a fever. Rachel took her to see a doctor, took her to the hospital. Diana did not want to see a doctor because she was afraid she was going to be stuck with a bill. Rachel got her medicine. Rachel said she is a single mom and just got a new job. She lost 8 hours of work because she could not find a babysitter at the last minute. Rachel is glad Diana is feeling better but she stated that Diana was used to living in a big house. Her previous hf had more money. She feels Diana is a little demanding. She told her that there was not enough food in the house. Rachel thinks there is always more than enough food. Rachel had promised to buy a table for Diana's room but has not gotten around to buying it yet. Diana asked her about the table. Rachel thinks Diana may be going through something or may be she is not happy. Rachel wanted me touch base with Diana. Overall, Rachel thinks Diana is a great au pair and is doing great with her son"
3626258,"things are going great, no news on the move. HM is very happy with the AP"

HM says that one baby really fond of AP and toddler is getting more and more close to AP.  AD provided some suggestions, including asking AP for feedback, to get AP talking so that HM can begin to learn about what the learning roadblocks are for AP. HM continues to give AP lists and expressed concern about ""offending"" AP.  AD encouraged HM to communicate with AP verbally, honestly and openly.  AD reflected that HM has been communicating through lists and it hasn't been working, so encouraged her to try new strategy.

AD also stated that AD would like to come meet with AP and HM to talk through the issues.  HM thanked AD, but avoided a meeting for now.  HM emailed later in evening that she had met with AP and that ""it went surprisingly well today, Na is improving, and she seems happy. I have to keep reminding her, but I think it's going the right way. She went to register for English class today, which is great because she needs it. I think she does not understand English very well, and she's too proud to ask again. I'll keep you updated, but I'm feeling more positive about our situation."""

There have been little things that mom has had to remind AP Lara of to keep her focused.  Mom says she is not going to get picky about it though because for the most part, AP has done a great job and understands AP has alot on her mind trying to tie up loose ends with her departure. Mom did comment that last month just after our monthly contact call, AP sideswiped the side of the garage with the car. When Hmom asked AP about it, AP said yes she did hit the side of the garage but when she looked to see if there was any damage done, she did not see anything.

3625140,Things are going well.  HM and I discussed that the HM still has some reservations but thinks it has more to do with her last match ending out of the blue then Sonia herself.  AP is making an effort with the kids but HM said she is not as warm and fuzzy as she would like.  HM did ask the AP to spend more time out with the family catching up on the day rather than spending all her time in her room.  AP was receptive and the next day made an effort to hang out for a little while before going to her room.
3625128,Spoke with Hm and everything is good. Started a new job and things have been a little hectic.
3625124,HF loves Lisa and they would love her to extend. They understand she is ready to move on with her life and they will continue with the program. HF said it will be hard to replace Lisa and that new au pair will have huge shoes to fill in. I advised HM not to think of new au pair as Lisa's replacement but of a new person that will enrich their life and love their daughter. HM said it will be hard. Last weekend whole family went to Seattle for a family trip. Lisa ws with them too and everyone had a wonderful time.
3625121,"Well.  They like her; she's a nice girl.  The boys love her and tell their friends that she is their friend.  Vilde's friend from home stayed 2 weeks which was long, but it was fine.  The only thing that has come up was she dropped off Josh at Hebrew school at 4 when it starts at 4:45 alone and left, but there weren't adults there yet.  HD Adam was very angry, and so HM spoke to Vilde and she cried.  We discussed the boys growing independence and how they can ride bikes in the neighborhood alone, etc. which is confusing, but HM explained about having a watchful eye.  Spring Break is next week which should be more work than usual but hopefully she can handle it."
3625108,"Wendy feels Gra has been doing a great job and is happy with how she has been handling everything.

3624550,"Things are not well at home.  Elissa went through Janine's phone because she had some suspicions about her activity with the car and use of the home.

She will not be discussing the issues with Janine until that time because Janine has friends visiting and staying with them on Friday through next week, then Elissa is away with her Mom coming to help out and then David will be back in town and he wants to be here for the discussion.  I spoke about trying to separate fro the personal and stick to the facts that her online/sexting and inviting men over to the home activity can not be tolerated due to the unsafe nature of such activities in there home and around there child.

With the wedding approaching Ginny feels that she is doing the responsible thing to take on more responsibility at home.  They are also involved with some custody issues that may prove to provide an even bigger change at home.  They interviewed an afternoon nanny to help out, which is interesting considering that they stated that they weren't going to need anyone.  She stated that they have been very happy with our service and if they find it to be too much, they will welcome another au pair."
3624537,"It has been unusually busy at the Joiner.  Angelina has been traveling all moth and her mom came to help which is great for Raquel and the family.

3624481,"The HM really likes the AP. However, she is extremely dishearten because she has taken the AP out and it appears she cannot drive.

I told her that it's a fine line between asking her to help as a member of a family and having her do things outside of her duty range. HM thinks that she might just be stressed and thaking things too personally. She will do a check in with AP once they move and go over expectations, rules, etc. She wants to be sure AP is staying firm with the kids and not taking the easy way out."
3623968,OK. Ap asked to have 3 guests come to my house in June for 10 days and it was a bit too much. I thought it was just one person at first and now its 3. I told her not to agree to it if it makes her uncofortable. She has a small house and doesn't have space for them to sleep. She said she will discuss it with Julia. Also ap is asking for too much vacation she already had 2 weeks off and wants more.

I said I would mention transitioning to year 2 upbeat with good energy."

She tried to talk to him then but she said he was enraged and put both hands around her neck and said he wanted to kill her, and said very ugly things to her.  He called the police because she wouldn't leave.  She said she waited for the police so that they could see she was sober and calm and then left because they told her she had to leave his house.  AP Alejandra said she would not speak to him again.  She was planning to live with him and go to school after the program, and he cosigned on a car together March 15.  She has paperwork about changing her Visa and he was going to put down money, but now she will likely return home as she does not have the $4k per semester.  The HF was upset and worried that he may try to come to their house to find her.  They called the police last night to file a report on him.  Alejandra said she was ok and he was going to give her the money back for the car, understood why she didn't want to speak to him again."

AD noticed through FB how she's been hanging out with a certain group of friends that tends to party at clubs.

3622529,All is going well. Nothing to report or discuss.
3622526,"HF is disappointed Ayse did not want to stay with them, especially since she told them she would. They made plans for August after Ayse told them she would stay. Now she changed her mind, and it is a big inconvenience for them to host a new au pair in the month of August. They had a questions about what would happen if they would want to start with new au pair in June. They wanted to know if Ayse could join new family before. I discuss early release of an AP and also credit for unused months in case they would end the match early. HF said they do not want to make a problem for Ayse but bringing new Ap in August might not be a good option for them. I helped HD with renewing the application. He said he would love to stay with AuPairCare because he loves service I am providing but he said we do not have that many Turkish au pairs and they might also look through another agency. They wanted to know if I am working with other agencies as well. I told HF this year they might have more options because they do not have a child under the age of 2. HF reapplied."
3622525,"HM happy to report she matched with a Brazilian AP for a June arrival. I told HM that I have other Brazilians arriving same week so they will all be friends.

HM reported Sean had an accident in the middle of the night because he was sick and climbed into bed with Ivan with dirty and wet PJ""s. Ivan said nothing and cleaned it all up.. HM bought Ivan all the junk food she could find as a Thank you.  Ivan loves Junk food and is trying to gain weight."

3622513,HM says all is great.  HM says AP has just been a perfect fit for their family and the kids love her.
3622498,"Hm and I spoke a few times this month and exchanged a few emails. HM reported that after I met with Ashley and spoke about some of the concerns she was doing a much better job. Then HM send email to AD about a Plane crash Video she showed Mark and Mark could not sleep and was crying and never wanted to fly again. Ashely reported it was not a plane crash video.  I told HM to ask AP to watch what she showed Mark.  Hm report a few other things about AP standing around doing nothing when grandma is caring for the children. HM reported that she could be helping with dishes, cleaning or taking out the garbage. HM also reported that AP will make breakfast for 5 year old w/o asking him what he wants and then the 5 year old will cry and get upset.  I took AP out to get her SS number and we spoke about these concerns. AP reported she will try harder."
3622497,spoke to HM several times this month. She continues to have issues with Ale. Earlier in the month HM asked Ale to take kids out of the house and not to come home until the certain time as some strangers were suppose to arrive to the house and HM did not want to have kids around. ale showed up with the kids. HM does not understand why Ale would not follow those simple instructions. It has been a constant battle. I spoke to HM again after Ale informed them she wanted to leave. HM said they spoke to Ale and they decided they can work things out. HM is not working now and Ale will be scheduled for less hours and HM will have more time to write everything down for Ale. Ale agreed she would like to have everything written down and she will follow and do everything HF needs her to do with the children.
3622493,HF asked me for my support regarding money for gas in the car for AP's school and driving the boy to and from his school. I told HM that I can't do anything for support until I get details with how many miles per week she drives and how much she pays her for the gas.  HM gave me the miles but did not give me how much she pays. I told HM that I can't support her until she tells me the amount.  HM also asked me to talk to her about writing down what she does with the kids during the day and teaching the 1 year old activities. HM asked me to talk to the AP at the AP meeting today but AP did not attend the AP meeting today.
3622485,HM stated that everything is good.  She feels that AP is happy and adjusting well to the family.  She is also getting out and making friends.
3622483,Fine - the family has been busy with the sale of the house - they will be moving the first of April (she will email me the new address)  Leila will be leaving May 8th for home and they will not have another AP at this time.
3622481,HM states that everything is fine.  SO spends a lot of time with the family and has not yet really gotten to know other APs in the area.  SO will be going t o VS for spring break.
3622479,Great - Jo continues to do well and fits in great with the family!
3622478,"Good - no issues, everyone seems happy right now! Sara is such a part of the family!"
3622477,Fine - everything has been going along well with everyone.
3622473,HF reported that things are going well with Joara and the kids. She is a fast learner and trying hard.  AD also took her to apply for her social security number last week so we met in person.  HM reported that her driving is not that strong and needs more lessons. HF paid for 1 and AP will pay for 3 more. If she passes HF will pay for license which is $75. AD took her out driving in HF car for 30 minutes and reported back that she could use more lessons. She was ok but needed to learn the roads and rules more and feel more confident.
3622471,Good - life is still crazy! but everyone is happy.
3622465,Fine
3622461,Good - they are doing fine.
3622460,Fine
3622452,Great
3622451,Good - they are sad to see Rebecka's year ending so soon!
3622444,"Great, HF has matched with new AP for July. Sad to think about Annike leaving though, as she has been there 2 years and it;s been great. She had some questions regarding scheduling/overlapping of AP's and a visit from their old AP. I suggested that old AP visiting in the first few weeks of new AP arriving might make things tough for her."
3622434,"AD spoke with HM, who has decided to extend with AP. She realizes that she wasn't feeling this way before, but she and her husband feel it is best. HM said ap is good with the kids and she works well with the babysitter."
3622414,"The situation with the AP is improving, but still strained and struggling because of the language barrier. HM feels that AP is truly trying to make it work with the children, but struggles with the three year old still. AP has started ESL courses and HM is hopeful that this will help the relationship improve."
3622413,"Very well. HM is very impressed with the AP and how well she has immersed herself in the culture. HM said that she is staying in San Antonio until Sep 30, 2014 and AP will be able to stay in Texas and just vacation with the family in Hawaii for part of the time through the summer. HF will pay for AP to get to the West Coast to catch her final flight back to Germany then."
3622410,"Good - Kelly is good with the boys, no complaints at all right now!"
3622408,"Good, Christina is doing a good job. Things have been a bit difficult as Seeley has been sick and in and out of the hospital again. They are hoping this next month will be better for him."
3622405,Estye says things are great with Tess! They are looking forward to their new home!They do not think they will continue with another aupair unless Tess decides to extend. Tess has expressed that she would like to extend and maybe be  somewhere else. We will have to  wait and see.   Estye is aware of new area director Jane Dexter and looking forward to working with her. Estye feels  the kids will be in school  next year and maybe will look at the program again in the future.
3622392,Good - things are going well and Julia seems to be adjusting well.  Her driving is coming along they are more confident that originally thought regarding them.
3622390,Great - Leeza is very happy with Suzanna and Ella is really doing good with her.
3622374,"good, working on matching for next year.  Advised him time is coming up quickly."
3622365,AD left a detailed voice mail with Deborah and will try again.
3622349,"Good, they really like Gabby and the girls love her!  They said they are leaving for Paris so Gabby will have some time to herself."
3622346,things going well and they just submitted their extension application - HF was a little upset that the fee was so high for the extension application so I explained the whole process to her.  She felt it was too much for the AP to pay and she is going to pay it for Marce.
3622344,"Good, AP likes to go by ""Fifi.""  She is getting settled.  Hm said great time for a meeting to meet other AP's."
3622340,Spoke with HM and everything is good.  Most likely will not be continuing in the program. Didn't give a reason just that they will not be able to continue.
3622339,Spoke with Hm and everything is good. Just getting prepared for the departure and arrival of AP.
3622338,so great -- just returned from a trip to Europe with AP and had a great time.  Really pleased to have a young man come next.  Discussed potential lunch/learn at Wake Forest Hospital.
3622330,Spoke with HD and everything is going well. Been busy with work.
3622322,Spoke with HM and everything is good. Ap did approach her about getting more vegetables and HM is fine with that. Hm also had question about reimbursing Ap for Korean food she buys. Ad explained that if it isn't excessive it would be nice for HM to reimburse AP but she should speak with AP about it.  HM has been discussing with AP about going to get her DL.
3622308,Thing are going well.  AP has decided to extend but would like to experience life in another part of the U.S.  HF has been looking at available APs in FR but so far hasn't found anyone that they are excited about.  HF is also considering other options for childcare.
3622306,"Things are going well.  AP has decided not to extend.  HM will be moving next year, but is not sure where she will be relocated so is unsure if there will be APC coverage in the new area.  AD suggested that a SEAP who is extending for 6 or 9 months may be a good option."
3622304,Things are going well.  AP traveled to Disney World with HF during spring break and everyone had a good time.
3622302,Spoke with Sonia at work - she said that things are going well and that Prudy is doing a good job.  She might go for a student visa which would be great for her.  Enjoying her class  and will be finished with her education in May.
3622301,I had a nice talk with Kelly and said I was sorry that we did not have the right candidate for her.  She said that she will come back next year as she really likes the agency.  I told her to reach out to me if she has any questions and her au pair is welcome to our group meetings. Minhee is terrific and they are so sorry that she could not extend.
3622300,Melissa is doing well and really likes Anne but she says she is not going to extend with her as she likes to do her own thing when she is not working and they like to have someone who will be more of a family member.  She said that the children like her a lot and she is doing a great job but since she has found some friends she likes to spend the time with them.  She has three children to take care of and I am not surprised that she wants some down time away from everyone but the HF want more of a homebody.
3622298,Michael called and said that things are going well - Josefine is doing a great job with the girls and is going to the Mass Bay classes.  She has met a lot of other Swedish au pairs already.
3622285,"She said things are going well, but busy.  Heather just started a new job and has been traveling quite a bit.  She is in training.  She said that Danielle is doing well."
3622283,"I spoke with Karyn a few times this month regarding some questions about traveling with her au pair.  They are going to Palm Springs with the whole family on a road trip and to see her parents.  It will busy but fun.  Otherwise, she said that things are going well."
3622261,Well.  Natascha had a birthday recently.   Her HF made her a special dinner and cake.  They also gave her a new purse for her birthday!
3622259,Very well.  The HF is really enjoying Szymon.  He's great with the boys.  We talked about his social life (very active) and his desire to travel.  I let Leif know that I sent Szymon lots of info about traveling outside the U.S. during this program year.
3622256,"All is going very well, no issues at all. HM very happy with NIcoletta, she is great and so funloving and outgoing.  Kids really love being with her. HM also called with a referral. - HF Karlis"
3622249,HD says that all is well with AP and they are happy that the extension went through with no problems.
3622240,Things are going better.  There are no issues this month.  Patty's boyfriend is coming in April.  Ella has a horse riding tournament so this will give Patty 4 days to be alone with her boyfriend.  Patty will be going to a weekend class in May.
3622239,"HM did speak to AD Hernandez beginning of month.  AD Frank had a long conversation with her on Sunday morning and she went over all the issues they have been having over the last 6 months.  HM explained that AD Hernandez had been helpful overall and had given good suggestions.  AP Megumi does well when she is in a routine, but does not do well when it is something different.  When AP came, she was a friend of their last AP, and therefore had very little experience or knowledge of what it means to be an au pair and needed a lot of training.  Her English is still limited and HM is sending her to more English classesAD Frank spoke to HM about letting company know if there is someone out there she may feel would be good for the job.  ."
3622237,"All is going very well with Piedad.  One issue did occur in January and repeated itself 3 times.  HM smelled smoke in the car and told AP that there is absolutely no smoking in the car.  HM does not believe that it was her AP, but rather friends.  When she smelled it a second time, she told AP again and AP admitted that it was the friends.  HM basically told her never again and it has been 1 month since.  AD and HM discussed that should she smell smoke again, she can tell the AP that her use of car will be limited now due to not respecting the rules."
3622236,Chris is doing well and gave me two referrals this week so we have been in touch a lot.  Everyone is fine and they are looking forward to Cristina coming  I told her that I had been in touch with Cristina and that she should have all the stuff necessary to complete the application by now.
3622232,Rachel is doing well but is really fed up with the weather so we talked about how bad the winter has been and it is still predicted that we will have snow this week!  Kids are great and Mai is doing a good job
3622219,Emmy is well as is the family.  She is traveling often and is anxious for Coco's application to be completed.  She stated that she had spoken with someone in the home office about his status.
3622187,HM stated nothing has changed and she lives with the way things are.
3622177,Hm and i chatted and she is pleased with AP thus far. HM has her outgoing AP training Ting Ting and is finding it's going well.
3622176,HM called to say things have calmed down with Magda and they seem to be communicating better. HM will update me with any ongoing issues.
3622175,"just fine!!  the baby is doing good.. (Note - born 2-19)  They won't be moving into their HB home until early may now.   They want all the remodeling done prior to the move in.  Julia is spending a lot of her non working hours with her boyfriend.  They are very happy for her, but want to make sure the fmaily is her number one focus during work hours.  She had asked the HF if her BF could visit them at the park on Valentines' Day - HD said yes, but only this once.  He does not want the BF to be a regular fixture during working hours."
3622174,Hm says all is well with their AP and they are very pleased. Ap has secured her date for flight back home and Hm is deciding to extend with a new AP
3622172,HM and AP are getting along very well and both sound equally happy with the placement. AP is starting school in fall semester.
3622171,HM says they are happy with their AP still and have no issues as they end the placement
3622169,"ok.  They had a little discussion the night before about one of the other APs and how she was treating Jules.  HM was upset that this AP spent the night at her house, and the AP took off to go sleep at her boyfriends house.  HM asked that AP not invite that friend over her to her home anymore.  AP tried to defend other AP but HM was livid and wanted to call the other APs HF about the issue.  AD suggested that the rules in her home are different than other's rules and that maybe it was ok there... but that she could enforce whatever rules she wanted to in her own home.  HM was ok with that and agreed.  HM smoothed things over with her AP but it is blear that this other AP is no longer welcome in their home."
3622168,HM has called about rematch costs and deadlines. we are working to get her decided on which to choose.
3622161,omg amazing.  She is so great and does such a good job at everything!
3622160,"oh wonderful, we really like her"
3622149,Great
3622142,AD left a voice mail with Kelly and will try again.
3622132,"So far , so good."
3622128,AD spoke with HM and HM said that AP's communication is getting better and that AP spent time with friends last night and came home very happy.  AP has plans to attend the AP meeting tomorrow.
3622123,"Things are going well, HF would like to know if AP would like to extend with them or not but are having a hard time getting AP to confirm. They think she wants to extend but perhaps with another family which is why they think AP is not letting them know.

3622072,"Asja says that things are going really well. She said that Andrea has really improved alot and matured alot since their meeting. She did an excellent job of taking care of Skyla this week when she was sick. She is being extra helpful around the house, doing extra things without even being asked. She's not too thrilled about training new incoming AP Dave, but Asja says that she will get over it. She will allow Andrea to remain in the home w/Dave working, for the remainder of her time until her flight home. She said that she's fine w/this, as Andrea has done a good job so she does not mind her staying with them after Dave is trained. She says that she's always out w/friends anyways, that she does not think they will even see her that much. She more or less will just have a place to stay until she returns home."
3622064,Very well.  Angie is doing well.  I have had a hard time getting in touch with Angie.  The ap is off this weekend but she typically works some hours on Friday nights at least.  She is very social.

3622043,"All good!  HF is going to wait until about mid-April to really begin their search.  They do want to make the May27 match discount deadline, but they feel the pool will be stronger in another month, and they have done this many times before, so they are totally fine.

3622042,"good, kids still love her"
3622040,Very well.  Laila just got a speeding ticket.  The kids were not with her though.  She was doing 48 in a 25 and did not have her license with her.  She's lucky she didn't get hauled off to jail.  I am going to encourage her to go to court to see if she can get a lesser charge.

3622020,Very well.  HM says AP is great and consistently goes above and beyond.  Only concern she had was that AP gave a drunk man a ride home from a bar recently.   HF is currently fostering 2 little girls that needed emergency placement.  Sisters Annabell (15 mos) and Alexis (2.5 yrs).  HM said AP would not be left alone to care for the girls.
3622015,Well.  Nothing much new since the last time we talked.  Kathryn continues to be pretty quiet though there is less tension.  They need to talk about when she'll take the rest of her vacation.
3622011,Very well.  Things are going smoothly.  Veri seems happy and the girls are doing well too.  No issues.  There have been a bunch of snow days this winter but they worked all of that out.
3622010,"Well, it's been less than 48 hours, but so far so good and the HF like her a lot!"
3622006,Quite well really.  Meike is a wonderful gal - they are very happy with her.

HM mentioned their evening sitter quit due to a family emergency and asked AD if I had any suggestions. HM stated they are not having any communication problems anymore."
3621997,"Going well with AP, but disappointed that she will not extend.  AP has had too much pressure from her family to return to China.  HM said they are going to go with GoAupair when their program year with APC is over because they really want a Vietnamese AP."
3621996,Lisa phoned in and had some questions about what is alright for them to ask ap to do household chore wise in the home. AP is leaving dishes from the whole day in the sink for HP to do when they get home. In general just not doing a good job cleaning up. AD said this was well within guidelines and they should have a sit down meeting with Marion to discuss . HF has a very laid back disposition and ap could be misinterpreting this as them not caring.  HF will get back to me.

HF is going to start looking next month as they would like a French speaking AP"

3621925,"AD spoke to HD as HM is currently in India traveling for work.  AP is great, but HD, a real joker, told AD that she refuses to help him cook and will only stir the pot once and then take credit for all the cooking.  They get along very well and AP is very good with kids and overall a great help."
3621918,"All is going very well with Beata, things are just great.  AP will be going this summer to travel with her friend from Boston.  HF is planning on moving to California this summer, close to Laguna Beach."

3621911,"Great - everyone is getting along great so far.  HF is starting to bond with the AP and transitioning to a new schedule.  HM was prepared to work harder, but is pleasantly surprised at how easy it has been."
3621905,HM and AP are starting to get to know each other and finding common ground.  AP is going to be leaving soon due to personal reasons.

HM feels that she can't invest anymore into the relationship but HD is stepping up and getting involved which has helped. HM feels that there are 8 weeks left and they can get through them. They will not be continuing in the program once the AP's year ends. HC will be going to school.

If there are any concerns they are always able to work them out. HF understands that sometimes things are a result of cultural differences and/or age. HF feels AP does exceptionally well with the HC so they pick their battles and nothing is big enough to ever complain about.
3621459,HM says situation hasn't improved at all AP still doesn't talk to HF. HM had to demand that AP speak to HC Raider to have him improve on his language skills.
3621428,Very well! HM can't believe the turn around that the AP has made. HM never thought it would be possible and they are seriously considering extending with AP for at least 9 mos. if not a full year.

HM stated that they actually have been in touch with Andrea over the past to get information as they have not had much contact with AD America.

3621212,"Hmom reports that things are well with AP.  Mom thinks that maybe AP is sad that her program year is coming to an end in June because of comments AP has said.  Example-  AP commented to Hmom that she is not looking forward to returning to Brazil because life there is very hard. Both Hparents and kids like AP but Hmom reports that it is apparent that AP treats this AP experience more like a job then a cultural experience.  Mom is not complaining by any means, she is merely making an observation."
3621197,well
3621186,Great!  All is well - we love AP - and are excited for her new school options -

3621143,well
3621132,"Spoke with Suzanne briefly and she said she could not talk but would update me on email. Here is her email:  Hi Wendie.   Things are going great with Kassie. She has truly risen to the next level in terms of Dylan's care and education: we place and replenish Dylan funds in Kassie's account and she enrolls D in music, swimming, and gymnastics classes, many selected and discovered by Kassie, on our behalf. She functions at the same executive level with travel. Whether or not Kassie accompanies us on any given trip, she always packs D's bag from her master list and is usually all ready the night before. Finally, Kassie has truly embraced the goal of not just feeding Dylan but educating her palate. My daughter has her own personal French cook who prepares all sorts of home-made goodies for her (quiche, flan, soups, ratatouille, gratins...), and feeds her other treats to develop her palate like stinky blue cheeses and all kinds of fruit and yogurt. The best part of this is that Kassie is pleased to be developing as a cook in parallel with D developing as a gourmande.   In terms of Kassie's education, she recently completed a business class through continuing ed at Stanford that reinforced her desire to study business and also was a lot of fun for her. She is currently taking an English enrichment class through the Palo Alto Adult School. She finds all of these classes on her own. She is increasingly building her education and career as opposed to taking classes to satisfy a requirement.   Kassie's facility and confidence in English have increased significantly in the year and a half that she has been with us.   Finally, we recently enjoyed a visit from Kassie's sister, Sabrina, and her family. They were here from France for 2 weeks and stayed with us for about half of that time. We were treated to more regional French cooking as well as many yummy wines and cheeses. It was wonderful to get to know Kassie's family better. We look forward to visiting them someday soon.   Thank you once again for all of your help and support.   Warmly,  Suzanne"
3621131,HF had to have another sit down with AP because she disobeyed the HFs request not to have a meeting with another nanny and her dog because the HM is afraid of dogs and does not want the kids to get used to a dog and ask for one. HM told AP that this was their last warning and that they want to trust the AP. HF will look for new AP to arrive early August and have Sarah leave early. HF will look for Mexico or Guatamala this time.
3621123,HM states AP is wonderful. She has no problems at all. We also discussed that it is time for HF to start looking for their next AP. When HM returns from her vacation she will start the search and let AD know if she has any questions.
3621121,HM says all is fine again and AP is doing well again. She is just anxious to go back to Brazil
3621119,HM very happy with Carolin. Is going to start her search very soon for a new AP as they will need to make the switch in July. HM feels that Carolin is and has been a very good fit for the family and really there are no issues at all to mention at this point in time.  HF did remember AD (Sibylla) from many years ago when they first applied to the program.
3621113,"Great - she's a perfect match for us!  she's still looking for her ""crowd"" but has a more diverse group of friends than prior AP - mostly hangs out with friend in Princeton - they're going to DC together this weekend - but great with HC and all round happy"

3619412,"HF feels things are running along smoothly after a crazy start (not the fault of AP)  They say they are finally back on a normal schedule.  Just after AP arrived - Hdad was out of town then when he returned home, Hmom left to go out of town then one of their daughters fell and had a concussion so HF says things were a bit crazy during the APs first couple of weeks.  But, now everything is back to normal, Hmom says they took AP to get her SS card and they have been able to show her around town.  Mom was glad AP made it to our whirly ball activity."
3619407,HM told me that all is well. They are getting ready for their family trip to the Middle East.
3619403,HD said that all is good. I confirmed with him that the extension application has been submitted to the DOS on 3/14 and we are waiting approval.
3619395,HM told me that all is well. Lucie's departure has been scheduled for mid June.  HF plans to see how they do over the summer without a live in and then make a decision on whether to replace in the fall or to keep going w/o an au pair.
3619393,"Everything is going good.  Sorry that I've had to hunt her down, its been a bit crazy.  Nadine is going to Chicago over spring break to meet up with her boyfriend and hm has arranged for her to stay with a friend for a few days so she has someone to lean on if need be.  They did have to have one conversation concerning discipline as hm's mom left and Eildon was steam rolling over Nadine.  Nadine has done a good job and started using the naughty step again.  HM asked her to extend, she's thinking about it.  HM will need an answer in April so she can start looking again if need be."
3619388,HD says that all is great with AP and no concerns.
3619376,very well. Will log into family room tonight to begin search for new ap.
3619371,"Everything is going great with Nina, hf bummed she can't stay longer, but are in selections and have an interview scheduled for tomorrow.  HM wants a little overlap so will have ap come in the week before Nina leaves.  Confirmed with hm she will need to pay them both for that overlap week."
3619369,HM says that AP is doing really well and is learning a lot from old AP. She says that she was a bit homesick early on but is much better now. She says that she is making her own friends as well.
3619361,HM says she had a great time with AP on spring break in Taos and never once did AP complain about the long trip.
3619356,"Things are going well.  No issues or concerns.  HM advised that they are considering a move to FL, but they are in the early stages of planning.  AP would be willing to move with the family if they do end up moving before her program year ends.  Gave HM info about where AD's are located in FL so they can stay with APC."
3619348,It is okay.  AP doe have some issues with the bunny - she doesn't want to clean up after it.  It makes a smell.  She likes the kids a lot.  They are getting along great.  HM is trying to do everything right.
3619327,"Great, no complaints. Very happy. Would like to extend but not sure about Anais will discuss with her as would like to know by June."
3619324,"Everything is going pretty good.  Emilie is really looking forward to seeing her parents in Florida.  Emilie will be with her parents the whole week and the family will be in the Keyes.  Emilie will fly down with Rick to Ft Lauderdale, then take a bus up to Miami to meet hr folks.  HM will fly into Miami and then meet up with everyone.  She has to go to Italy first and give a couple talks.  Hm will ask Emilie if she's interested in extending next month."
3619312,"All is going fine with Lena. Deb let me know that she really wants to stay with APC and with me, but she is not seeing a big pool of in-country extension au pairs.    Asked for help and I let Jeff know."
3619303,HM says all is going well and HM said that things have stayed the same.  AP gives excellent care to daughter but still somehow feels separated from the HF.
3619295,"Per HD, he is so sorry, Sarah had asked him to call me back as she's so busy and he forgot.  It's always ok for me to contact him for checkin.  All is going good, Nikola is great with the kids and good with the family.  They finally got the basement put back together after the flood, thank goodness."
3619292,"Iris said that all is fine with Natalia.  She is fine with Natalia staying until the end of program year -- but worries the prospects wont be good for September. I let her know that should not be the case.  All is great with Natalia, though."
3619286,"Placement has been improving.  Unfortunately, AP was travelling to santa Barbara with boyfriend this weekend and he died.  Something happened and they went to the hospital; he had 2 surgeries to control internal bleeding, but he didn't survive recovery from the 2nd surgery.  AP has been a wreck, sleeping all the time (its only been 48 hours, and HM is fully understanding and supportive of the issue).  Ap mentioned she is going to finish out her term but wants to change her flight home because she had travel plans with bf and now can't bring herself to go alone; she'd rather return home.  AD speaking with RM about looking into flight change."
3619283,HM says all is going well.  HM says AP has continued to do an excellent job with the kids.  HM couldn't talk long since she was at work.
3619279,HM says all is well with AP no problems. She has paid her bills nothing to worry about.
3619274,This HF continues to be happy Justyna. The HM had her gall bladder out and is feeling much better. T his has alleviated a lot of stress. The AP mentioned that this HF is looking at ways to keep her in the country with an extended education Visa.
3619270,This HF continues to be happy Nan. All is well with no complaints.
3619267,This HF is doing well. The HD inquired early in the month about getting registered to match. They recently matched with a Korean AP and are very excited about it since the HM is Korean. They will be very sad to see this Caroline go.
3619254,APs grandmother is very sick and on her death bed and HF is OK with AP going home for one week from Sat to next Sunday. Other than that all is the same and it is going OK.
3619253,"HM says AP is their best ever, kids love her HF likes her, great work ethic and all. Unfortunately AP doesn't want to extend."
3619247,All is great.  HM really feels that Dudu is the best ever and they do not know what they are going to do when the year is over.  She just fits into the family so perfectly.
3619244,"HM says all is going well.  HM is due next Wed, March 26.  She is having baby at NW hospital.  AP will not extend, since she has to go home and finish school."
3619242,"Spoke with Shannon is all is great with Alison.  AP should hear back regarding nursing school in April, then they will decide what to do going forward (with house remodel, new AP, extend,...).  She asked that I have account statement sent for taxes."
3619227,"Well.  Steffi had a friend over without the kids while she was working and Sade felt she was distracted.  She is a very sweet girl, but sometimes gets distracted like that.  She knew Sade was no happy and got the message so she thinks everything is ok now.  She understands things come up you have to address and they haven't had anything to address with her.  She asked about extending and I told her the fees and deadlines.  She was really surprised, I supposed thinking there wouldn't be fees.  I emailed it all to her so she could see it on paper, with the $1100 discounts/early match, and I also calculated it out for her to see it is still $7-$8 and hour."
3619224,HM says all is going well with Amanda.  She was driving and couldn't talk long.  HM says AP is going to take TOEFL exam.
3619222,HF and AP are doing well and have a good routine. AP has 10 days vacation next month and is going to CA. AD told HF to start looking now for new AP to get the early bird bonus.
3619111,Everything is going ok. Family has been sitting down with AP often to make sure everybody is on the same page.
3619106,Everything is going well with Grape.  She had been eating meals in her room and we have ants now so just told her to eat in her room so she is fine with that.
3619095,Everything is going great with Marie! She is doing well in school and we have a good trip.
3619094,"All is going very well, is happy with AP.  Have worked out schedule.  HM had a question as to how many weeks vacation an au pair gets when extending for 9 months.  AD replied 2 weeks."
3619082,Good. Search just started. Very confident HF will find a new great AP. HF has been happy so far with both APs they have had. AP Anna does not want to extend since she wants to be home for her fmaily. AP Anna has been very kind to the girls . HF + Kids are pooped from Purium but they had fun.
3619080,"Things are going okay. A couple of issues.  AP forgot to close the minivan door and drove into garage and ripped up the siding and the whole side of the door. HM waiting to hear what the cost is.  AD reminded HM that the AP is responsible for up to $250 maximum.  Also, AP sent boys to school on the coldest day without a coat and HM was very unhappy with her about that.  HM is struggling as AP is not as proactive as the last one was."
3619050,"HM still struggling with Frank as he is not communicating with her.  One issue happened last week when Frank called HM as she was away on a business trip and told her her son was not on the bus and he was worried.  HM called the school and found out that son was in afterschool activities which Frank had signed him up for, but he had forgotten. HM frustrated that he is just not paying enough attention to detail, but he tells her that she is too quick to jump on him and point out mistakes he makes.  AD is going to speak to Frank again to ask him to be more proactive, pay more attention to detail and to comunicate"
3619049,"Mary and Jim decided to not ask Meme to extend.  They feel that it is best considering that her and Jim can be very up and down in their relationship.  Meme is disappointed, but she has not let it show.  She is being positive and cheerful.  Meme is struggling to meet the education requirement for extension, so it may be for the best."
3619034,HM says all is well no problems.
3619008,"HM feels that the transition is going to be tough from old to new AP, as old AP has been with them for 2 years.  But she is excited to meet her new au pair.  New AuPair goes by Paola.  Maria is doing great and has been fabulous for the last 2 years."
3618984,"Lisa is just great and family is really going to miss her when she leaves.  HM is picking up new AP today and is excited, but also a little worried about transition.  HM and AD spoke about the do's and don'ts in a transition."
3618983,Jeanine says everything is great with Ju. She is eating her last American cookies and they are getting Brazilian recipes from Ju. They will miss her!
3618972,Fair at best
3618959,"Everyone has been sick, HM, HC, now AP but we are surviving - AP on vacation next week in Cal., HF on vacation next week in FL, HM working from home, etc.  AP still wants to SE with a family on west coast, HF reassessing needs for next year - probably won't need an AP but would extend with Gabi if she were interested"
3618953,They re doing well. HM glad AP decided to extend for six more months. This will get them trough the summer.
3618949,"It is going well. They are in Wichita visiting HM's family for a few days. They were going to Texas to see HD, he is on an 8 week leave with the military but it was too much driving."
3618938,All is going great. HD so happy AP decided to extend for one more year. He bought her a ticket home to Brazil for two weeks to see her family. She will return next week. HD wants to host one of monthly meetings and have a BBQ at his house in May/June
3618934,"HM stated everything is going well.  HM stated she would like to start searching for her new AP early.  They don't need an arrival until August but got a lot of help from their ME last time and want to do that again.  AD will check with ME and see what the timing should be for a new search. HM stated this AP has been the best one yet and has been great about everything, even walking the kids to school in winter."
3618915,"HM is very happy with Lesly  She is helping out alot with the 15 month old and always helps where needed.   HM says Lesly is not as good of a driver as she had hoped, Lesly is timid behind the wheel so they don't have her driving the children to school yet.  HM is encouraging her to get out and drive more for practice.  HM has scheduled C-Section on April 4th so Lesly will be tending mainly to the 15 month old and 2 older kids when they get home from school.  Husband will be home 1 week to help and HM mother is coming to help too"
3618914,"everything is good. Svena is going this weekend to Washinton DC with BMCC. Svenja is taking a class at NCC on Thursdays at NCC. AP considering extending.

August HF will travel."
3618910,"I talked to Melanie a long time yesterday.  I had sent her a preparation email last week and we went through it, she told me about the things she had done and had left to do.  She is ready other than things like the cell phone, which she will do with Katty.  The kids are counting down the ""sleeps"" until she arrives.  The grandmas are happy too.  The one who was in that room, has moved to the next room so it is ready for Katty, and they will overlap a little which should be a nice transition.  Everyone is excited."

3618882,"HM shared that things are going well overall.  Undergoing a separation but, the AP and the family are working thru it.  Shared the AP has been wonderful about it and there are no concerns at this time."
3618876,"HM & HD was on conf with AD.  Shared that all is well so far.  Feels the AP is doing the basics, doesnt leave the home too much, isnt as active as they would like her to be but, they chalk that up to personality.  AP is caring the for children and no specific concerns to discuss."
3618875,"HD shared that is has been a great yr, a great many yrs with the company and he is pleased to have been a part of it.  Shared his appreciation of support given at a local level and stated if he ever found himself needed another AP for his children (though they are big) he would come back without thinking about it twice."
3618873,H mom working like crazy. Kids are very busy with sports. Zach had a stomach bug earlier in the week. HF will ask camilla in May to extend. HF feels camilla is a nice girl. She had made new Brazilian friends. Last night AP ran out to go to the movies. H mom was dispointed that AP did not communicate bette rto the HF. Kids had not done their homework.

3618860,ok
3618859,"Everything is fine.  They are moving at the end of June (closing 27th) to Wilmington, 7518 Masonboro Sound Rd., Wilmington, NC 28409  and want to keep Maria though the end of her year in September, but aren't sure after that.  HM Heather has a couple of job prospects and is thinking she will only work 4 days per month and is ready to retire at the beach so may not need any help.  But she is not sure yet, so will think about it.  She doesn't know about extending with Maria since her boyfriend is in Raleigh and they are so in love.  She's afraid that could be complicated.  But she will decide in the next month or so.  The house in Raleigh sold in 23 days.  It was quick and fairly painless so she is much less stressed about it all now."

3618625,Everything is going great with Anny.
3618616,"Everything is good. Danila is very sweet. She seems to be a bit better with hygiene, but still does not wash her hands when she first enters the kitchen.

Her husband is having a hip replacement next week so Danila will be needed to walk and pick up Christopher from School."

3618501,"Good, Knows she needs to complete extension paperwork. Would ideally like to extend for year but Anki prefers 9 months. Might just check with her again as HF concerned April might be a harder time to match. I said it shouldn't make too much difference as although summer busiest time for ap pool also busiest time for families looking so more competition."

Also, HM says that AP has been late again for an evening shift.

3617247,I thanked HF for hosting for the last two years. HM shared she had a wonderful experience and that Ammy will always be a part of their family. hM will work 80%less and will not need an au pair.
3617236,Rachel said there is a possibility they could be relocating to Newport Beach and wanted to know how this would affect new AP since it will be around the time she arrives. Told her its a great opportunity for AP and AP follows the HF.
3617213,"HM says that Pauline is going to school pretty regularly, but her English has not improved that much.  She is doing a great job with the girls and the house, etc. Overall everything is good. They still haven't decided about the extension but will soon. Their kids have spring break next month but we will be staying in town most of the time."
3617212,All is good - HF is very pleased that extension was approved
3617208,HM says AP has decided not to extend and will go home in July.  HM is trying to adopt a baby and had questions about getting a new AP through the background check process.
3617203,AP and HF have adjusted extremely well to each other.  AP has made a few good friends in the cluster which has helped her adjust.  AP attended February social and may attend March social if family does not go skiing for the weekend.  AD suggested that AP meet the Carter HF AP who also has two new puppies and kids Martin age.  AP will send email to introduce the families
3617193,Great.  HM and kids are going on vacation next week.  AP July is going on vacation to New Orleans with her sister.  They love having her there.
3617185,well
3617173,"Good, she said looking for new AP in family room."
3617171,"Good, she said same old, same old.  She said she was surprised David isn't traveling at the endof his stay but maybe he is ready to be going home."
3617170,well
3617169,"Good, looking forward to the vacation with the William's family."
3617165,Everything is going good. The family has asked vivi to extend for 9 months.. Vivi is still working on getting her PA DL.
3617161,As usual everything is good.
3617160,Everything is going good. They had a great time celebrating Dani's bday.
3617157,Everything is going really well.  Starting to look for new AP when Ceci leaves.
3617155,I said my last check in call.  HM said yes we have nanny who started and it is working out well.  I said glad to hear that and take care.
3617140,well
3617128,"Very well.  HF has decided not to provide AP with a cell phone.  HM mentioned that AP had gone to pick up HC and he was being held inside school for testing.  I asked if AP had been concerned when she couldn't find him and had no phone to call and HM said no, all was fine.  HM asked me if it was okay to give AP feedback.  I reiterated again the importance of weekly meetings and starting off with positive feedback before she criticizes."
3617080,really well
3617072,"They are all good now, but last week everybody but Paula got the stomach flu.  Paula was a big help with the kids and they are grateful that it is all over now."
3617071,fine. Michael + Nancy get a long great . Nancy does not always clean up after dinner well. H son does not like doing homework but Nance encourages him. Michael starts baseball next week tuesday + thursday. He should be more tired playing outside.
3617068,Things are wonderful and they all love Suzanna.  HM said she is a very good fit for their family.  Alex actually cries when Suzanna leaves him.
3617064,great
3617059,They continue to do well.  HM said that they are still leaning toward getting another AP but they are not 100% sure yet.  I advised them that all they need to do is reapply when they are ready and they will be placed back into selections.
3617056,"HM is thrilled with AP, she just can't talk about losing her yet. She is happy that they found and matched with new AP. She says she think she will be a good fit."
3617019,"APO done on 3/18.  Things are just ""ok"".  HM seems very anxious about having to retrain a new AP and wants things to be at the level she was at with Busra before she left.  We discussed that the adjustment and transition takes time, as it did with Busra.  HM understands but she still seems frustrated.  HM is also concerned that Jacob wants to come find HM during the day - and not just be with AP.  We discussed that this bond between Jacob and AP has to grow and will take a bit of time.  AD noted several times while I was there that Jacob called out to AP and laughed/smiled with her about something.  We discussed that it is very normal for kids to prefer mom if she is around.  AP is already driving on her own.  We discussed that AP should take Jacob out each day for several hours and have fun together.  This is what Busra did as well.  That way HM can work and AP and Jacob will grow their bond.   HM seemed a bit better by the end of our talk, but things are still tense.  HM also stated that she feels AP is very negative about things.  AP explained that she is quiet and reserved as that is her culture to be like that.  HM stated that she is frustrated by that because she wants to make sure that AP is happy here.  We discussed that as they get to know each other better, this may improve as AP feels more comfortable with her new life here.  This match will need to be monitored closely.  AD told them I would be on vacation next week and that AD Renee Kulman would be available if they needed her."
3616981,Alyssa is planning to take the kids to Japan April 29-May 8 so she would love to be able to meet the next au pair face to face during that time.  So she is thinking of beginning her interview search the last week of March (returning 3/24) or beginning of April.  Told her to renew her app when she is ready.
3616971,"HD shared that things are great as usual.  Shared discussion surrounding current AP departure, expectations for the next AP that is coming, etc..Feels confident that they have found another great AP and asked for suggestions on how to acclimate her well upon her arrival.  Talked about the confirmation date that is necessary for outgoing AP for credit purposes, etc..  AD will rcv info soon and send to the home office for proper accting."
3616949,HM said Marisa is finishing her class at Georgetown this month.  All is good.
3616939,Spoke with Amy. She said that things are great with Carol. They are relieved that Carol's extension went through. Amy is going to write a letter to Sojourner Douglass regarding their refusal to sign the education paperwork. Josh's Grandfather passed away last week so they have had a rough time.
3616938,"match is going well; they had several questions about extension with emilija being 27 already, process, insurance, and taxes for which i provided answers."
3616920,"Judy a bit tight lipped about commenting on Angel, said she needs to see more to make a judgment. Said she is happpier his English is better though and can talk to the kids more."
3616875,Was sad to see Alice go as really became family. Seems to have been relatively smooth transition over to Sarah though and Alice was very helpful with this.
3616864,HM says they had a great year with AP and are happy to have had her. HF has bought a new house and will move to Lost Creek area.
3616840,"Jen still isn't really happy.  I have had numerous conversations with her about rematching.  Her husband is feeling like they will just choose better next time, the kids are safe, but Jen is really dissatisfied and almost teary. There is a very poor connection between them and June hides from them in her room when not working, but June tells me she does spend time with them and communicates well. Jen hears June talking loudly and fast, laughing on Skype and has never seen her like that with them.  So she doesn't think it is her personality.  She thinks it is a bad connection."
3616839,"Allyson said all going well with Magda, of course. She was really busy so could not talk long."
3616830,"Heather got back to me. All is fine with Ambre. She apologized for not getting back to me sooner. She is really busy, too busy, she said.  Family is working on getting Amber a F1 visa. They plan on sponsoring her."
3616829,"Everything is fine. Things were tough for AP when HM was in China for work, but everything is back to normal now."
3616828,"Jeremy said that the match is going as well as expected, given the divorce.  They may be moving Olivia's bedroom as part of the divorce. He wanted to give me a heads up."
3616826,HM says AP is taking good care of the children. The only problem that started coming up was that AP got into a fender bender downtown and hasn't told HF about it. Then a neigboor saw AP being pulled over and AP didn't tell HF so there are some issues.
3616804,"AP's program ends tomorrow, so AD called to wish HM and AP well.  AP has been accepted to Strayer University.  She is going to remain living with the Solomon family, and is changing her VISA."
3616799,great. HF potty training Danniel. Oldest H son  Jonathan going skiing this weekend with his dad Drew. HF hoping to move in the summer. HF waiting to hear if closed in the end of June. HF hopes after getting settled to go to Seatle to see in laws. AP took one class and thinking of taking next class at BMCC or Malloy. AP Monika is a great girl. She works well with Jonathan . They do homework together and go running together.
3616786,Placement is going fine. AP leaves this week. HD hopes to visit her in South Africa soon when he travels.
3616782,"AD spoke to HM and she says that things are going well and they are glad that they were able to resolve the driving issue with Maca. HM says that still it isn't the perfect situation, but it's working out okay until April 15th.  HM says that they are working with S.A. to find another AP."
3616767,HD has been going great. HM is beyond busy so having an AP has been great. AP has been terrific.
3616764,HM said the baby went earlier than he was supposed to.  HD will be picking up new AP at the end of the week.
3616747,"HM shared she was sitting in with her accountant but, shared quickly that all was well and she had no concerns.  Shared if there were any concerns she would call me right away."
3616736,"Well.  She is preparing for Madeleine's arrival.  She called with concern that Madeleine didn't have an important paper to get into the country.  After she arrived Alicia called again and asked about NC Taxes.  She wanted me to tell her which form to use, about the standard deductions for au pairs in NC.  I said that I don't have info about NC taxes, she should ask her tax preparer.  She said she did and he didn't know the answer and as an APC rep I should have info about the form to use.  I researched on the internet and emailed a CPA and was told AP's use form NC D 400 with no std deduction, but that I am not licensed and cannot say for sure whether that is a fact or not...she should look up the form, verify it or make her own decision."
3616732,HM says that everything is great. HM has jury duty this week.
3616727,HM says that the everything is going really great.
3616718,I spoke to Jennifer and she said they are doing great.  She said they are going to the Dominician Republic for spring break and she wanted to know if Juli needed to do anything for the trip.  I told her to check with the US embassy but I would email her the travel website for her country and I think she is fine.  She also asked me about Juli extending and she said she knows it is way off but they would love her to extend.  I went over what she will need to do.  I also reminded her about the aupair meeting and she said she will be there.  She thanked me for the call.
3616716,"Everything is going well with Gaelle. She reimbursed the HF for the phone and all is good. HM is looking at applications, but the one application she was very interested in can't come until Aug. She will continue to look"
3616711,"Saw Christine in person at a gym class.  Things are the same with Laetitia.  All going okay, still."
3616710,Very well. AP just got back from her vacation. No complaints. She is doing well.
3616696,"Spoke with Karen.   Smoking still poses a problem. The family has been really busy  Called a handyman to upgrade her bedroom. Karen said that Ivana seems pleased/happier. Other than that, all is good.  Asked Ivana to be more communicative about the kids.  The kids take advantage of her somewhat.   Continues to work on that.  Planned a trip - going to Paris - Ivana taking a week with her host family and then they are going to Ivana's hometown."
3616694,"HD called to say AP had informed him she is ending the program early and going home.  HD is very upset about this, as they are only 2 weeks into their extension year with AP."
3616691,Very good. No complaints. AP is a very good person.
3616676,"All is going very well with Giovanna.  She is just great, happy, nice and friendly and easy going. HM going in for major surgery tomorrow and AP has already been helping and stepping in to do what is needed."
3616673,All is going very well.  A little hectic overall.  HM had open house today for brokers as they are selling and moving to California in July.
3616668,"All is excellent with Elin. Kids really love her, she is managing them very well, always happy and funloving.  HM left AD a message"
3616666,"AD spoke with HM, placement is fine, HM revealed that AP had been cranky and snappy with the kids. This caused HM to talk with her, then AP made a big announcement in front of the children, She said she is going to return in September as a student and is being sponsored by the neighbor. HM was shocked and disappointed to find out this way. HM spoke to AP later, explaining that she had hoped they built the kind of relationship that she would have included her in on the planning. HM also talked about the uncomfortable feelings attached to having the AP live a few homes away, having knowledge of their privacy.  AD brought up hours, and HM went over schedule, hours are within regs. We spoke about the AP feeling overtired, and over worked at times. HM said AP has been overworked organizing how she is going to stay in the US, but it is definitely not by working with the 4 kids while they are in school all day and her day ends at 6:pm  HM says repeatedly, AP offers to assist in the evening, or do a pick up, or take to a sporting event. but that it is not scheduled. AD talked with HM about possibility that AP is looking for signs of appreciation. HM agreed and said she will do more to show her gratitude. HM and AD discussed end dates as AP inquired about departing in May."
3616660,All is good with Tricia. It was her birthday a few days ago.  Still looking for a job. Things are fine with Karolina.  She said something to the effect that they are comfortable with one another in way that happens mid-way through a placement.
3616655,Alicia said that everything is going great with Maria Jose and the kids. She seems to be meeting more friends through Facebook and is doing well.
3616648,"AD spoke HM, placement is very good, extension application have been submitted and everyone is just waiting for approval."
3616645,"AD spoke with HM, placement is going well, HM offered an extension to AP, but she declined. HM is currently in selections and appreciates all help by AD and ME. AP attended a weekend course, said it went well. she is complete with her courses now"
3616641,"Having a little stress at work, but all is good on the home front with Sandra."
3616609,"AP is doing well.  HM is considering extending, but is not sure if they will stay with the program another year."
3616595,"Well, as usual.  They moved to 821 Claude Laurel Dr., Apex, NC  27523.  She had to be in Australia during the move because of the FDA and her job, but it turned out fine.  Debora, Sarah's friend and Ardian worked together and got it done.  They are settling in now and Debora has the whole 3rd floor, more space.  We went over the timeline remaining...She said she is in denial about Debora ever having to leave and cannot imagine another person taking her place, she's Ari's Godmother, she's so easy, grateful, doesn't ask for too much.  The baby will be 2 when Debora finishes, so they may get one more AP, but she isn't sure yet.  It is hard to think about and she has been trying to get settled through the move, but we talked about the RFR, Debora's end of program and said she could have the farewell stuff for Debora in December and have the next person arrive in January after the Holidays, rather than trying to overlap them and have the sadness of having her leave with another person arriving mixed with the Holidays.  She said that was a good idea.  She will think about it beginning when school gets out in June.  She is considering full time preschool when Ari is 3, so one more year."
3616584,Hm told me that so far things are great with Joaquin. The boys are getting to know him and HM is happy to have a male figure in the house that can be more authoritative with the boys.
3616574,great - brought ap with them on vacation to turks & Caicos and it was the best vacation ever - would not have been able to do it without her - raved about AP
3616547,I spoke to Krissy and she said they are doing great.  She said they are all settling into a routine and all is going well.  She said Sarka has been driving some but she wants to study some more before she takes the test.  She got her social security number though and is going to the college tomorrow to register for class. She will be at the aupair meeting on Sunday.
3616536,"Kate is doing well. Is was a rough start, but everybody seem to settled into a routine. She is calm, respectful and always does what she is told. Only complaint is the HM stated she wishes she would be a little more playful with the kids."
3616514,Ana is doing great. She had a good vacation and is back in the rutine
3616491,spoke briefly to HM. Everything is going well
3616476,Everything is going great.
3616474,I spoke to Bren and she said they were doing fine.  She said she talked to Alejandra and she feels like she just didn't have a good trip to California and she came home grumpy.  She said she has been helping out and things are going fine now.  She said they are moving to Ft Campbell in June and her husband will return then so they have a lot going on to get ready for all of that.  I told her to let me know if she needed anything.  I also reminded her about the aupair meeting on Sunday at 1:00
3616458,Bara is doing well. The girls love her and she is flexible and mature. Her mom is coming to visit for 2 weeks in Sep
3616446,Good
3616428,Everything is great with Fernanda. She is staying for a week together with Kathe. The HF is excited about Kathy's arrival and will pick her up early Thursday
3616426,Vey well! HM loves AP and thinks she is doing a great job.
3616421,"Wonderfully! HD feels that he hit ""the jack-pot"" once again with AP Bednarova. HD said that he actually feels that they are an even better fit than previous AP whom he was very happy with."
3616408,Oceane is doing well. She is everything the HM expected her to be. Her boyfriend is coming to visit and the hF is excited to meet him
3616404,I spoke to Monty and he said all is going well.  He said Suni is taking classes at FTCC ESL which is going well and she is getting ready to take an online class one of the other aupairs let her know about.  We talked about the aupair article and I let him know to send me some more referrals.  I let him know when the next aupair meeting is and he thanked me for the call.
3616390,Good
3616379,"things are going great, No question or concerns. Ap will be extending with the HF for another year. AD went over deadline and online applications"
3616372,"Hmom reports that all is fabulous with AP Vianey that she is just ""The Best""  Mom says AP is always so helpful, kind and is always smiling and happy.   Mom said AP loved our last Whirly Ball activity and wants to do it again.  All is well."
3616371,Snezana is doing well. She is great  with the kids and always happy and energetic. HM has addressed her concerns and things are now much better

3616326,Good
3616318,Good
3616302,HD says that things are going well. HD says that Linda has met an AP from another agency. HD says that they are assisting Linda in signing up for a class as her English still needs some improvement.
3616298,Good
3616293,Bret is doing a fantastic job. She is great with Josh and has been a tremendous help with the move. They are discussing extension and the HF is thrilled she is staying
3616271,"everything is going well, HM is very happy with Linnea and have no issues. HM is already looking for an Au Pair for August ."
3616267,"All is well with AP. HF decided that at this time, they will not need another AP. I thanked HM for being such a great HF for so many years and reminded her that she will still get referral bonuses if she refers HFs."
3616264,HM says that everything is going wonderfully with Manu.
3616223,"going great. Erin returned my call. she is doing well with the kids, takes them to the park and also makes cookies with her son for school every once in a while."
3616154,HM says things are going very well.  Everyone is happy.  No questions.  AP received her ss card in the mail.
3616151,James stated Maria got engaged last weekend and wanted to know if she could leave the program a few weeks early. He wanted to know about the refund policy and repeat HF discount.
3616135,HD returned my call. Reports that everything is working well.  No complaints.  They are very happy with her driving which was the most important thing for them.
3616133,Excellent.  Gilbert  continues to be a delight to work with.  No problems.  He handles Peter very well.
3616125,Excellent.  They are really pleased with Minda.  their son is gradually warming up to her.  She is dong this just the right way   Sara is back at work now.  It has been a fun experience so far.
3616120,"HM says that they are overall happy with AP and that the kids like her very much.  However, HM says there have been a few issues over the past couple weeks.  HM says that they have very defined rules about the children not watching tv, listening to the radio or playing with electronics (outside of designated screen time) and they have found that AP has been driving in the car with the kids on several occasions with the radio on.  HM also says that AP has not been taking the kids to the park/library daily as she is supposed to.  HM says they have spoken with the AP about it and hopes it will not be an issue in the future."
3616113,HM returned my call.  She says everything is good.  No issues to report.  they are in selections to find their next AP.
3616056,"HF and AP are doing well. Nothing new to report. HC have been sick and oldest HC is on spring break, so they are keeping busy."
3616022,"Kristi is doing a great job! She has been struggling with dental issues. She has an infection on a root cannal. Insurance does not cover a root canal. The cost to have a root canal is $950. She does not have that $. The Dr gave her a perscription for the infection and a rinse. AP going this weekend to Washington , DC. The twins still cry when the family leaves the home however Cindy calms them down and distracts them. The boys have a tumble class they enjoy that Kristi takes them too. AP mostly takes care of the little ones. AP keeps up with the laundry. Kids are still adjusting to mom working. Mom is working till May ."
3616019,"HM says everything is good.  No issues.  HM's due date with her 2nd baby is this Friday.  They will likely start looking for their new AP in April, after the baby comes."
3615989,Karen says Cristina is so helpful. Karen is getting more rest and the babies are growing well!
3615967,"Good - things have been a bit  busy trying to get settled, but all seems to be going well."
3615961,HF is very happy with AP. She has bonded well with the HC and Sofia loves the AP. AP is taking a photography class and AD explained about hours etc. Sofia is going to Israel this summer and HM may join her there and spend some time. AP will be off.
3615957,"Very well,  AP and HF have been having candid conversations about the day to day experience with the kids.  HM is very happy that AP feels comfortable to come to her if AP has had a challenging day. HM is interested to begin looking for a new AP for August arrival."
3615952,Good.  HM said everytrhing is good with AP. They have been busy with work and finally closing on their new house.
3615951,Things are going very well. HD still does not understand why AP is home all the time he says she does not do much but she is happy and does a good job with her job she is just not very social. They are all going to DC tomorrow for a few days for Spring break. HD will start looking for new AP in May. They want to get another one when this one leaves
3615941,"The year has gone well and the family is still considering whether they want to host another AP.  HM shared that the AP made plans for her travel month but, really didnt consult with the HM about her plan to stay with them, etc..it was just assumed and the HM was a bit annoyed by that.  Stated she has seen a recent shift in liberties and wants to keep the match strong the way it was previously.  AD recommended that she spk very honestly with the AP and let her know her feelings.  HM said she would and let me know how the converstation goes upon their return from vacation (spring break)"
3615923,"Great.  AP really extends herself in terms of helping with the kids.  HM feels odd to mention this, but AP helps so much that HM does not get a chance to balance the 2 kids on her own sometimes.  HM wants her kids to learn how to ""entertain"" themselves.  HM does not want older son to think that someone is always going to play with them.  HM loves the AP and thinks she is truly wonderful."
3615921,"Hm has successfully reapplied.  She is interested in candidates that can drive, are interested in possibly a two year stay, compassionate, warm and outgoing.  Someone that is educated and has possibly lived on their own before.  Everything with Jovana is great and they wish that she were staying another year.  HM stated that she is 5-6 weeks pregnant and hoping for the best."
3615912,"Caroline called back and said she was worried about June still and hadn't heard from her.  I said I would call.  Everything was great with Saori, but Caroline hadn't been feeling well, headaches, and couldn't sleep, so she has been sleeping from 8am-3 everyday, which is why she has missed my calls.  She said to call after 3.  Then I saw she went to the hospital."
3615911,HD shared that things were primarily good. There was an incident that occurred last week that the AP refused to move the car over for alternate side of street parking and the family got a ticket.  AP shared that she didnt feel comfortable moving the car without another adult.  The HD & HM was upset because she told them upon matching that she was a strong driver and now she is saying that she has never drove without an adult.  AD suggested that they take her on a test drive to see her ability and then make a determination of what to do next.  If she is too weak (discussed rematch process) and if she just needed a refresher run then it could be ok.  AD asked the HD to keep me posted on what they observe after they come back from vacation.  HD confirmed he would.
3615905,Very we.  APs family is coming into town for 2 weeks in April and AP will go on cruise with them for one of the weeks.
3615903,"Well.  Robson is a terrific person, very professional, cares about his work and the family. They have a great connection and communication.  They include him in everything and he is comfortable to come or not.  The only issue is the weather but can't do anything about that."
3615894,All is well with AP. They are discussing last day of work and APs return flight. HF is not sure yet if they will look for new AP for August/September and will be in touch.
3615878,AD spoke with HM and HM said that her current AP is doing great and everyone is getting excited about the arrival of their new AP this Thursday.  HM said they did decide to take everyone to Hawaii in a couple of weeks and hopes the trip will be fun.  AD and HM will figure out a day and time for AP Lidi's AO on Friday when they speak for the Welcome Call.
3615865,It is going well. AP is trying hard and they get along. There are some small things they are still working on but overall it is good. They will start driving with her again to practice. HF is going away one week in April and two weeks towards the end of June to France.
3615864,Things are good. This Thursday there is another court date as HD is working towards gaining custody of HC. HM is allowed to have a 1/2 hr conversation via Facetime with HC and AP assists with this. Contact between AP and HM is dwindling which is good as HM was manipulating AP into telling her what HC and HD was doing during HC's custody time with HD. AD has had numerous conversations with AP explaining that she shouldn't feel the stress of the divorce and that it is important to communicate her feelings with HD and AD. AP is an outstanding and strong AP and HD continues to love the way she handles HC.
3615863,AD spoke with HM and HM said things are ok with her AP.  HM doesn't have any complaints about the AP's ability to do her job and the children enjoy having her around however HM is still trying to figure out if the AP is shy or naturally a quite person.  HM said that the AP does not spend a lot of time talking to the HP's and seems shy around them which HM says is a little bit of a conner for her.  AP does spend time with friends when she is not working but typically prefers to be in her room reading or at the gym a couple of days a week.
3615858,Things are still going very well. HM is now considering another AP as HD will retire from police force but may still continue working. HM will consider another nationality but its important to HF that the AP be Christian.
3615856,"Things are gong well , HM wishes Ap would get out more and make friends but Ap is good with the kids so that all the HM could ask for"
3615845,AD spoke to HM and she says that things are really great and she is excited about the move. HM says that they could not have chosen a better AP.
3615840,"Well. AP is going to do one of the travel courses. AP loves dog, but barking drives everyone crazy."
3615839,It is going very well. AP is adapting well and they like her personality. The boys have taken to her. She is a good driver and her English is great. They went to Branson for the weekend and had a good time. AP has been sick since she got here. She had strep when she arrived and now a cold but it seems to be getting better.
3615838,"Nothing new to report, just winding down with current Ap and waiting for the new AP. No questions or concerns"
3615825,Things are not good. HF went away on vacation to Aruba and came back to a horrible mess. AP was gone for weekend and left her bedroom door locked. HM managed to get the door unlocked and found her room a complete disaster. Empty food containers everywhere. Sticky substances and soda bottles stuck to the dresser. It was evident that something was spilled on the carpet and then AP tried to clean and was unsuccessful. There was a bottle of antibiotic pills left on the bathroom floor. Small jewelry left on the floor and clothes everywhere. The car was left without any gasoline. In the car was an odd smell and the interior was dirty. Host Parents were very upset and consulted with AD several times over this past weekend about what to do. AD suggested making a clear list of what was wrong when they came home and things that need to change in order for the placement to move forward. AP came home evening on the 16th and was very remorseful and now knows that this behavior will not be tolerated. AD emailed AP list of things that must change to avoid the match from breaking. AD to reach out to AP today to confirm receipt of email and talk about the situation further.
3615779,Robbie said all is going well with Luiza and the kids are doing well.
3615764,See notes in problem report above.
3615763,Katie & Eric said that they are doing well this month. The kids are doing well with Sabina.
3615754,"HM informed me that awhile ago AP Annie asked if they would consider her staying on with a student visa.  After researching this and finding out it would cost $20,000 they said no.  Annie made it clear she does not want to return to South Africa.  She found a boyfriend online and has been having a long distance relationship with this man in Washington, D.C.  In the last two weeks she said to HF that she will marry this man and convert to the Muslim religion.  She has told the family she can no longer eat their food but will buy her own food.  She now covers her hair with a head covering when leaving the house.  She keeps her eyes averted around men.  The most bothersome thing is that AP Annie has now told the HF due to her religion she cannot talk to the HD - which is highly inconvenient.  They got her to agree to communicate with him through notes.  This is not ideal.  She has also been warned about making politically charged comments about 9/11 outside the home while she is out the with children looking Muslim."
3615753,Ingrid knows she needs to be patient but she has concerns about new AP. She seems a little slow and does not keep pace with the HF. She also was stopped for driving through a Stop Sign and given a warning. Encouraged HM to be patient.
3615748,well
3615746,Going well. Dagmara is sick right now. We took the kids today so she could sleep in.
3615739,"call back from Lisa, things are going well with Andrea, no questions and alll rules are being followed, will talk again next month"
3615737,HM reports that they are doing great and love their AP.
3615733,Everything is good. Raquel didn't pass her driving test by 1 correct answer.
3615727,Excellent.  They said that Monika is an incredibly self-less person.  She saves much of her weekly stipend and sends the money home to her sister to pay for her university.  They spoke to me about their long history with APC and all the wonderful experiences they have had with past APs. They reported that Monika just got her mass license and is very proud of herself.
3615726,"All in Palm Springs for few days including Lisa. Also talking about going to Mexico, Cabo in Nov. said was ok to got to Mexico on second yr visa. Glad 6 month extension approved."
3615721,Spoke with Maggie and everything is going well.  They haven't had a full conversation about extending but Tana mentioned that she may want to extend for 6 months but go home a little early for the holidays.   This would not work out for the family.  I explained the approval process for an AP going home early and said that it wasn't really an option if they didn't approve it.  HM said 9 months would be ideal for them or just to get a new AP.  I will email Arrival Dates and Extension or New AP Discount information.  They will speak to AP soon.
3615720,Spoke to HD. Said they like AP and he is good with the boys. He is a good driver. Not sure about extending yet.
3615708,Things okay. Lily likes Jacki. Still not sure what shell do come august but I suggested she get back into family room regardless as doesn't cost her anything to have that option.
3615706,"HM said that for the most part thing are going well with new AP Clemence. HM did comment that AP is ""young"" and ""needs reminders."" Also, HM commented that AP doesn't really talk that much so she is difficult to read. HM said that her younger kids have bonded well with AP. Also, HM said that she had to leave early one morning and that AP had cleaned the entire kitchen after breakfast, which was a nice surprise. Also, HM came home to be surprised again that the AP made homemade crepes and chocolate fondue. HM said that AP tends to spend a lot of her spare time with them, which HM enjoys, so she wants to make sure that AP is also spending entire of her spare time with other APs."
3615704,AD spoke to HD and he says that things are going great. He also says that the AP has picked up their routine very well and is eager to please.
3615685,well
3615679,"spoke to George there are some problems with Erika; the driving is a real problem, she is not good yet. The driving instructor says that she needs ten more lessons and she already has had three. They have had to grab the wheel from her...."

3615659,"Connected a few times over the weekend and have been playing phone tag with the HF. Pam, the HM initially had a problem getting to see the new AP's due to not being signed up but I can see that has been taken care of. She is also considering in country and we talked about Magda Sladkova, which the Hf finds interesting. Everything is good with Ianele."
3615655,Spoke with Amy and all is well with Sarah.  APs family is coming out soon to visit so they are all excited about that.  She asked about the timeline for getting a new AP in July.  I will email Arrival Dates and Program Fees.
3615639,"Crazy with the kids. They have been sick. H mom went over this PM with AP clean up routine since things were not always getting done. The girls are all over the place running, climbing. AP had no problems adjusting . She has a great network of friends near by."
3615636,AD spoke to HD and he says that things are really great. They will start the extension process again very soon. AD will resend Extension application and Ext FAQs.
3615618,Things are going well. Julia was driving back from Boston while we spoke. Ana will not be extending because of school. Ana will help her host parents with interviewing. Julia expects it to be easier now that she knows what to expect.
3615616,Spoke with Danielle and she said things are going great with Vera.  I do know that AP is not as happy with the placement but she wants to work it out on her own (see notes in AP).
3615609,Spoke with Erika and everything is going great.  Magda did see a doctor about her ankle and she is better.  HM said she was surprised by how much AP owes in taxes (around $600) and had questions about how AP files.  I told her that AP got an email with all the information and can attend webinar coming up.
3615595,"Spoke with Caroline and everything is going great.  She has not had time to talk to Karen about not-extending, but they will find a time soon.  Karen is gone in the evenings after they get home so they rarely see her."
3615589,Excellent. Stacy agreed to allow me to place APC trifold a in her studio in Cutchogue
3615588,"AD spoke to HD and he says that things are really great. HD had questions about extending with their current AP; and possibly selecting an OSAP. AD answered HD's questions and emailed EXT FAQs and 2014 arrival dates docs. HD was also concerned with the AP integrating with other APs and the family. HD says that the AP is great with the HC, but doesn't spend a lot of time with the family."
3615580,"Spoke with Michelle, and she feels that Josiane is doing great so far.  She is more mature than other AP's they've had and she appreciates that.  She is doing great with the kids.  They want to drive with her a few more times because Josi is not yet comfortable driving here yet."
3615576,Things are going well.  HD asked about the possibility of allowing AP to go home early since HC will be spending most of June and July with grandparents.  AD advised she will get specific info on process for early release.

3615496,Amina says things are so much better  and they are very happy.She thanked me for coming out and helping them..
3615488,"Everything is going well, hf going to Mexico for 10 days and are super excited.  HM has reapplied and we walked through the process.  They have internet access in Mexico so it would be a good time for Ginny to select for them."

3615447,Good
3615397,"Spoke with Jeff.  Everything is going really well with Lizeth.  She really wants to be part of the family, and Sydney didn't even seem to notice the change in AP's.  Jeff asked for documentation for his child care reimbursement and I said I would email Winnie."
3615394,Good.
3615391,Hande is very happy with Katherina.. She is mature and easy going and seems to be happy to play with  Tallie.Everything is really good!

3615344,well
3615322,AD spoke to HM and she says that things continue to go well. HM had a question regarding her AP receiving tax information. AD explained that tax info. was sent to the the AP's old email address and the newest email address (2 times).
3615321,"Everything is great. HM was frustrated with an email I had sent about APs being required to attend activities. She thought that it was not appropriate to ask HF's to arrange their schedules around this. I thanked her for her feedback and told her I understood her point of view, but reminded her that it is in the HF agreement that APs attend the events."
3615316,All is going well. HM had questions about AP's return flight and HQ was able to answer her questions for her.
3615311,"HM says that everything is still good with AP. She says that she knows AP wants HM to be more warm/fuzzy,  but she says that she is not built that way.

3615310,All is going well. HM is away on business this week.
3615305,very well.
3615304,Everything is going fine. HM had questions about the transition to their new AP. I let her know Carol's last day with them would be May 20th so she would be out of the house before their new AP arrives. I also asked if she would be willing to write a letter of rec for Carol and she will get back to me with that.
3615303,very well.
3615302,"HF is close to matching with an AP from Mexico.  A couple of APs they liked already matched or are not available, so they hope that their 2nd interview with AP Anna goes well tonight so they could match.  Other than that, things are well."
3615298,Katy says everything is good. They just had a birthday party for  one of their daughters.
3615296,I called the HM to see how everything was going before the scheduled mediation. She confirmed she has sent the write up of the previous issues even though they had not been mentioned before as requested.  The HM thought the AP would get better with time.

HM says that they have been in touch with S.A. and should start their search very soon.

Betsy and Mike told Leila they were happy to have her visit. Leila was planning to take vacation when her friend was here. Leila told Betsy that her friend was planning to stay for 3 weeks. Betsy and Mike are not comfortable having the friend stay for 3 weeks. In addition, they cannot give Leila 3 weeks off and are not comfortable with Leila working while her friend is here vacationing. They feel is it distracting. HF may be comfortable having the friend stay with them for a few days and have them take a week's vacation somewhere else. They will talk with Leila. The girls are great and everything else is going really well."
3615250,All is going very well. HF very happy with Seda and hope that she will extend with them.  Went over when to start looking for a new AP and also to make sure that they are in the under 2 category as HM may have another child soon.

3615244,Great
3615240,"Pretty well.  We talked a lot about Rahel's car accident.  She totaled their car by running a stop sign.  The girls were in the car with her at the time though no one was hurt.  HD is trying to fight the insurance company because they had put about $10,000 in the car in the past year and a half.  The car was old and had quite a number of miles on it however.  HM was not happy about it.  Things other than that are fine.  Rahel is having family come to visit as well as a friend.  The HF is going on a cruise in April for a week.

3615199,"Pretty well. Kelly said that Petra is doing a better job lately.  She is able to multi-task a little more.  She's picking up after the kids more and her relationship with them seems to have improved.  HD said she is a bit sarcastic with them and they don't respond well to that.  She seems down and not very enthusiastic about her job.  Some days go well though and those days Petra seems fine.  I gave them a lot of advice, especially when it comes to taking her on vacation with them. They are going skiing in Colorado.  I told them to please call me with any questions or concerns."
3615182,well

3615153,All is great with AP - they are still looking for a permanent home -
3615152,Well.  Things have improved quite a bit since we last talked.  The relationship between Inga and the host family's youngest child is still not perfect but it has improved.  Nora thinks it is a personality issue.  It isn't that bad but HM is still a little concerned and continues to try to help Inga so it improves.

3615142,Very well.  We talked a lot about Luisa's troubles with driving.  Kristy said she needs a lot more practice.  It has been difficult because we've had so much snow.  We also talked quite a bit about Anien's plan to extend.  I let Kristy know that Anien has not yet done the extension application.  I also have not seen Anien's education completion paperwork.  Kristy said she would speak with her about it.  The deadline is 1 April for filing the application.

Mom said AP is not able to come to whirly ball as she had made St. Patricks day plans with friends."
3615086,"AD spoke with HD Kosti -- on the first try, which is possibly a first!  He sounded well, and said that Cami continues to do a great job, and that they are very glad she stayed for a second year. The children are well, and everyone is ready for winter to end.  Match 100% compliant, and Kosti will ask AP Cami to return AD's call"
3615083,Spoke with Ginny. She said that things are going ok with Gabriela. She is not warm and affectionate but does her job. The kids are fine.

I told her I saw her last Wednesday and she seemed happy.  Kara said Lele told her she has met a bunch of new girls and had fun at our dinner.
3615031,"Pretty well.  HM said that there are some times when Maria doesn't use good judgment.  There was a drip in the ceiling of her room one morning last week but she did not tell her HP about it.  By the end of the day, it became a much bigger problem.  She never told her HP about it.  HM also said that she can be uncomfortable with the way Maria dresses when she is going out with friends.  The HP are very conservative and are a bit concerned about what their daughter will think when seeing Maria dress the way she does.  We talked about that for a while.  Not all South Americans dress the way Maria does.  Some are quite conservative."
3615017,Trip to Canada went well.  Having video in back for kids was very helpful.  Not going to get another AP after this PY... needs to take a break.
3615009,"HF had great year with AP.  Said our pool of candidates wasn't sufficient for him, so he matched with a SA AP from a competitor.  Would like to get another German next time and get started looking in November.  Told him I would get in touch with him in November and hope we can help him next PY."
3614997,well
3614990,HD says that everyone is great and have no concerns. He says that they have applied for a green card for AP and hope to know something by May. He says that they are planning a trip to FL in July.
3614977,"HM Chetanna is very pleased with AP Gisele.  She states that ""it is an adjustment to have such an on-the-ball au pair!""  She likes having to make that adjustment, though.  She is impressed with AP's organizational skills, and feels very confident about her ability."
3614963,"Very well.  Cheryl takes things in stride, for instance, all the snow days where the children are all home from school.  Keith and Stacy are happy with the job Chery is doing.  He couldn't tell me why Cheryl didn't come to my event last week.  She goes to school Tuesdays and Thursdays."
3614935,"HM Angela says that things ""are going incredibly well"" with match.  She talked about ""different hats"" she and AP wear as a part of their relationship (""friend hat""; ""host hat""; ""employer hat"") and how things are dovetailing smoothly at this point.  Angela already hopes that AP will extend with them for year two, although she realizes it is too early to commit."
3614929,very good-HM is worry about AP not to have friends. I told HM today about 2 AP arrival.
3614923,"checking in for March, things re going ok, all rules are being followed, still has issue with attitude of the ap, hm does a lot for her and she still questions things that aren't her responsibility, example hm asked if she would mind taking the clothes out of the dryer because she was running out with the children and Maria said she wouldn't do it because some of the laundry was hers and not the children's... meanwhile the cleaning lady doe the children's bedrooms, bathroom and bedding so Lori thought she could at least take the laundry out of the dryer for her.  Doesn't get the give and take part of the program, also changed her hours from 1 to 1:30 one day because she realized she wouldn't need her as early as she thought and Maria said she needed more notice if any hours were changed... she could have left it at 1:00 but thought it would give Maria a little more time to herself."
3614919,"Very well.  Nili said the relationship is going very well.  They are happy with the job she's doing with the boys.  Nili dropped her off at my event last week and stayed while Asli met other au pairs.  She asked about extension - they are already talking about Asli extending for another year.  I sent her the FAQ's and deadline dates, etc.  Asli's english has improved quite a bit."
3614899,"got my message, things are going well with the children and with Eri, no questions, all rules are being followed, will call if they need anything, took weekend class at CW Post and now will take a class at NCC"
3614881,"AD spoke with HM, she is happy with her successful year. She knows Jack will miss AP very much. She is looking forward to the new arrival and hoping its just a good."
3614844,"AD spoke with HD who was a little frustrated with AP for always having concerns about her schedule because he says the schedule is consistent with no changes and if any changes are made it is to let the AP off early because he or his wife want to care for the kids themselves and at that moment, their schedule allowed it.  AP seems to get frustrated if the HD or HM say, hey you can have the morning off today because we are going to drive the kids to school, or if they say, hey I am done work early, so I am going to pick the kids up from swim team. HD says he wrote out the schedule but also explained this all to  her and said to her that he is not going to apologize for wanting to spend time with his kids and that she should look at it as a good thing."
3614835,We are all very happy!
3614833,Things are going well. HM feels that AP is a lovely woman. HM feels that she is not letting herself fall in love with this AP as much as she has her previous APs because she is leaving so soon. HM also stated that she might be interested in going OS for next search because the possibility of having someone for 2 years is so appealing.
3614821,Sarka is doing really well. She had friends in from Czech this week and she had a few days off.
3614814,HM reports that AP is super human and keeping up with the busy family.
3614813,"AD spoke with HM, things are okay, AP will be ending her program early on June 4th. HF has no problem and will sign early departure approval letter."
3614808,Barbora is doing okay. They took her on vacation and it was very challenging while on vacation. The two weeks after they came back Bara had a very difficult time. She was homesick and she was very forgetful and spazy. Things are back to normal and she is her own wonderful self. The HF wishes she would make a few more friends her best friend is very negative
3614806,HM hopes AP will stay another year because she is just awesome.
3614797,"Things are going fine. Confirmed with HF that AP has both original DS form from original HF, and DS form for HF Chenlov. HM confirmed this is true."
3614751,"Things are going very well, AD and HM have spoken a few times over the last week,. HM had some questions about school and getting a Canadian Visa. Hm also had questions about Ap going to a Dentist about a tooth ache. HM is very happy with the program"
3614744,HF is doing well.  It's the first time in 13 years that they stayed in town for Spring Break and HD said that it was relaxing at the beach house.  AP is doing well.  AD had concerns about what's happening in her home country Ukraine with all the political turmoil.  HD also spoke to AP about it and it seems she's handling it well.
3614743,"Things are OK, HM feels that the personalities are not a great fit, but Ap is good with the boys and getting everything done. HM will stick it out for a year. AD gave HM some suggestions."

3614724,AD contacted HM.  Discussed AP events and a good contact number for Caroline as it has been difficult to contact her.
3614722,I wished HM the best of luck in her next placement and told her I would miss working with her. I let her know that I am hopeful she will come back to the program next year.
3614721,HD stated that everything is going well & they have had no issues or concerns with AP. AP's relationship with children is good.
3614710,"things are going very well, HM wishes AP would go out more. AP seems to be a home body and that's fine she does a good job with the kids. HF took the house off the market and will not be moving"
3614704,AD contacted HM.  She is still a bit stressed that the baby is not taking as much food as they would like.  She was at a funeral out of town over the weekend and her husband took the AP out to drive and she had no skills.  She didn't know how to drive a stick and told HF in the interview that she did.  AD made driving school recommendations.
3614698,Everything continues to be going great. AP went to Portland this last weekend.
3614693,Things are going very well.  They are having a hard time opening a bank account for the AP.  They are going to use the DMV letter I brought and try another Chase bank branch.  Another AP in the neighborhood did not have an issue.
3614692,The AD spoke to the HD on the phone.  The HD reported that all is well.  The AD and HD spoke about the AP leaving soon and he said he can't believe that two years has gone by so quickly.  The HD is not sure if he will get another AP yet and asked if it is easy.  The AD let him know that he would need to interview again and offered help.
3614689,"All is going very well with Lucie, thank goodness she is still here.  HM was thrown from her horse and then trampled.  She has 3 broken ribs at spine connection and is basically out of commission for a few weeks."
3614685,"things are going very well, HM will Ask AP to extend this weekend and go from there. HM has a feeling she would like to stay"
3614683,Things had been going fine.  This weekend the AP left and caused the HM great worry.  See problem report below.  HM and I were communicating for several hours Sunday night trying to locate the AP.
3614680,"The AD spoke to the HD on the phone.  The HD reported that all is well and the AP is 'perfect.""  HM is due in August with new baby."
3614678,"Spoke to HD that states things are going perfect, he is hoping AP will extend but thinks its too soon to ask AP at this time so HD will wait 2 months."
3614670,"Things are going great, AP has decided she will not extend do HM will be starting her search again. AD went over the early matching savings so HM will start her search soon."
3614657,The HF reported that she is looking forward to the rrival of the new AP.  The AD and AP discussed some ideas for a good-bye party and gift for the current AP.
3614649,AD contacted HM about AP's mother losing her fiance'.  AD reached out to see if I could provide any additional support and thanked her for being so supportive to the AP.
3614642,All is going very well. Spoke to HF about signing up again. Let them know that they should have received an e-mail regarding the early match discount.
3614639,Bruna is doing well. She is very consistent and responsible. HM not sure she wants to extend but will make a decision soon. HM stated that she looked at the pool and wasn't impressed
3614625,Everything is good and AP is fitting right in with the family.  HM has no complaints.
3614623,The AD spoke to the HM on the phone.  The HM reported that she really like the AP and feels like this is the way it should be.
3614620,Pretty good.  HM thinks AP is a bit disappointed HF did not extend with her.  AP self extended.  HF wants an AP that will get involved with family.  Current AP is an excellent caregiver but prefers to be with friends or on her own during her off hours.  AP is hoping next AP will want to spend some time with HF.  AD recommended that HM express this desire at the start of the match.  HM says AP can return to Japan April 21 for a few weeks.  HM is releasing AP early AD said seh will send paperwork for HM to sign to release AP early
3614618,"All is going very well with Johanna, she is doing great.  HF is getting ready to start the search all over again."
3614610,"HM said that everything is going very well, no complaints.  HM said that she would like AP to extend, but she does not think he will extend because he is applying for jobs back in Germany."
3614601,All is going great with Ana.  HF is going to extend with her for another year. Very happy that she has decided to stay.  She is great overall.
3614597,"All is going very well with Elin, no issues at all. HF is looking for a new AP soon."
3614590,"THings are going well, there was an incident witht he AP going into NYC airport and almost missing the bus for the children, she did not call the host mother and it was upsetting to the HM.   We discussed it and HM has moved past it but felt it was irresponsible and a safety issue.  Calls email and discussion indicates that the AP and HM are otherwise doing fine and willspeak about the possibility of extending but not just now."
3614586,"Things are going well, HM is looking for a new AP, has not had a lot of luck. AD spoke to her about extension au pairs and HM is interested in speaking to the one in NJ."
3614567,Everything is going well with Franzie. She is great. The HM said the are close to matching wit Demi and are scheduled to have their final talk on Wednesday.
3614566,Fine.  The family has hired their Nanny going forward.  She and Simone have overlapped the past couple of weeks which has been good.  This is Simone's last week of work.  She will be on vacation after that.  HM told me that she made a mistake by not making Simone take more vacation in her first program year.  She took less than a week so is making it up now.  I let both AP and HF this is not allowed but its too late now to change that.  Simone is staying with her HF w/o working from 22 March through 12 April when her sister arrives.  They will then travel for a few weeks.  Simone will return to her host family's home early May and stay until she flies out on May 15/16.  The HF is hoping to come back to APC next year once HM's internship is completed.
3614555,Great.  They are currently in selection and looking at APs.  She was wondering if there was an in country AP that they could look at.  I said that I would look into the APs that are available and email her.  She emphasized that they need someone very capable.
3614538,
3614504,Very well.  HF loves Tati.  She is really happy she got someone who was already here.
3614499,Well.  Nina's flight out of Chicago got canceled so she spent the night at the airport.  She had to fly back into Dulles instead of Reagan and is now making her way home.  Didem said things are tough but they are keeping Nina unti her year ends.   She will do whatever she needs to do to help Nina find a good family.  They will probably put the house up for sale in April/May of this year.  They will move into Didem's parents house once the house is sold.  Nina will go with them - we talked about her sharing a bath with the kids which I said was fine.
3614495,"This family is doing great and are happy with the AP. Melody expressed that the kids are very taken with Alberto, and he has done a wonderful job in exceeding her expectations and has actually expressed an interest in doing more. She could not be more pleased at this point."
3614486,"This family is doing great and are happy with the AP. They are really starting to look at new placements and had some questions regarding this. The HM said she might be interested in this position down the road, but probably not right now."
3614485,This family is doing great and are happy with the AP. The HM inquired about the opening saying that she had a friend who might be interested.
3614468,great. Except AP is in vacation and back in Brazil visiting her own family. AD thanked HF for referral
3614466,Things are going well.  Leni is a part of their family.  She's great at playing with the kids and they have a great relationship.  Things are going very smoothly.  HM trusts her completely.  Last weekend she went with the family to Silver Diner for breakfast.  They enjoy spending time together.
3614464,"Everything is going wonderful.  HF is very pleased with the AP and they are hoping that she will decide to extend even for a little bit.  However, it does not look as if the AP will extend."
3614457,New AP Silvia just arrived two weeks ago.
3614453,New AP Amable will be just arriving in LF on March 21.
3614446,Very well - AP Marta is everything they expected an AP to be!  She took her written driving test on Friday and missed it by one wrong.  She is going back today to the DMV to try it again.  They are leaving in one week to go to Puerto Rico and are taking AP Marta with them.
3614428,"The HM expressed some concerns regarding Sylvia’s first 6 weeks. She shared that she had backed the car into one of their other cars the first time she was to go out driving on her own. The HM sought advice on what they should do since they have not granted her driving priveliges since the accident. The AP keeps asking to drive on her own. The AD advised that she look into driving school. She asked if it was unreasonable to ask her to pay for part of it, and the AD said she didn’t think so since it would allow her to drive on her own. The HM wasn’t overly concerned about her driving the kids since the school is a very straight forward route less than a mile away. The HM then asked if it was normal for the AP to stay in her room all the time. The AD said this could be a warning sign that she is homesick. The HM thinks she is definitely homesick because she knows she misses her mom and boyfriend. The AD suggested they sit down to a meeting, praise her strong points, ask her for her concerns, then express theirs asking if they can do anything to make her feel more comfortable spending more time with them for meals and such. This would also be the time to suggest the driving school. The HM also mentioned that Sylvia is giving some pushback on getting her IN driver’s license since none of her friends have it. The AD told her that they can insist, especially since I highly recommend it and also due to her accident. The HM said she feels as though they all want to make it work, so she would like to apply these suggestions. She asked if there were tell-tale signs of the AP wanting a rematch, and the AD expressed that unfortunately there is not, but they need to really open the lines of communication prior to it getting to that point."
3614421,Juli is doing well. The HF is sad to see her go. She will stay around for her 13th month to say her good byes. Explained I will be away the week after her arrival and scheduled the A/O
3614417,All is well.  They are taking a family vacation the first week of April.  They will be going to Disney World and taking AP Josy with them.  HM commented that AP Josy had a lot of fun at Whirlyball yesterday.
3614412,HF and AP are discussing 12 months extension. AD gave deadline info. AP is planning a trip home before she starts her second year.
3614406,Spoke with HM. Things are ok with AP. HM found out ap's parents are coming in May. Ap did not discuss it with HP. HM had to show AP how to keep her bathroom clean and remind her to get things done. AP still not as communicative as she should be.
3614394,All is going so well.  HM is very happy with Paola.  She is now letting her drive the boys on her own to limited places.  She is getting closer to taking the driving test.
3614385,They are working on the driving with AP Cathy.  Cathy is only 18 and just got her license back home so she is relatively inexperienced.  HF has told her that she must be able to drive the children when HM goes back to work.  This is a deal breaker.  I told HD some HF use a driving school.  I told them I would forward the name of the one the Krieger HF is using.  They will consider that.
3614383,"AD spoke to HM and HD. They are planning to move to Denver CO in June 2014 Estimated. They had several questions regarding selecting a new AP--either an OSAP or ICAP.  AD answered their questions and explained the match process. The HF loves their current AP, but feels as though she isn't 100% comfortable going to CO. The HF plans to speak with their AP; and they all will come up with a decision and then notify AD. AD will email info on when a match breaks and will also send info for AD in CO per HF's request."
3614376,Good. AP and HM will meet this week to talk about extending. HM thinks AP will want to extend with a HF in Richmond and not with them due to the AP's schedule changing with working some weekends in Farmville. HF will not be in Farmville or Richmond FT but between both.
3614371,Lulu is doing great. She has eased into the job very well. She is great with the kids and they really enjoy spending time with her. She has made many friends
3614369,"Very well. AP has opened up a bit and is not staying to herself. HM loves her and states thatshe is a very sweet girl. AP went online and taught herself to knit, HM thought that was great. AP is looking forward to building a snowman today."
3614368,Amy and the family are well.  They are waiting for Mile's school acceptance letter and hoping that he will receive sibling priority.  Delphine has decided to not extend for another year.  She will be returning home.  At this time they are unsure what will happen with their au pair status.  They have some decisions to make over the next two months.
3614362,Jessica is doing very well. She is a smart girl and is enjoying studying for her classes. Her and Nicole are doing well also. Nicole is a teenager so of cause they have their discussions
3614355,Fine. No complaints.
3614352,"I spoke with HM on Friday, 3/14.  we scheduled APO for 3/18/14 at 4 PM.  HM believes AP is very homesick although AP won't admit it to them.  HPs are very concerned AP isn't eating much and I emailed HM some information on how to handle homesickness.  I also emailed AP info and resources for her to use.  AP was not able to make our monthly meeting this past weekend as HF had plans already."
3614348,"Things are oaky, HF stated Last AP will visit next month and current ap will have her family in town. No issues or concerns."
3614342,Fine.  She will be breaking her match with AP Lorena so she can leave June 1.  I emailed her to find out if she wants a refund or a credit for another au pair.
3614337,Good. New AP arrives this week. HF is looking forward to her arrival yet sad to see the other AP leave.
3614336,"Great, AP has decided to extend with HF they are thrilled . AP will travel to AZ with HF for one week. AP will be completing her courses upon return and applying for ext"
3614333,Lisa is doing great. Can't believe she is leaving soon. Looking forward to Andrea's arrival. HF will be on vacation for a week after she arrives and Andrea already knows.
3614329,All is good HM ha to run into a client meeting. AP is great
3614323,Good. AP is wonderful. AP is very engaged with the HC and the community. AP is a great asset.
3614297,Good things have been very busy in the house preparing for the move.  HF is hoping since they haven't put the current house on the market it will help everyone with the transition.
3614295,"HF wants to sit down with AP to go over a ""same page"" meeting. HM will call back because she was in the doctors office with son.  AD sent info about DL to AP and HF. HM feels that the AP is not bonding with 2 year old and that it actually makes more work for the HM because the 2year old does not want to stay with AP. AP is also not flexible with shabbat hours and HF and AP will discuss that as well."
3614273,everything is going well. Hannah is very helpful and teaching children German language. Hannah was taking Philadelphia trip this weekend returned back on Sunday.
3614256,We are adjusting nicely.
3614229,HM says that things are going very well.
3614224,"T2 Ami things with Ap are good, they will be reapplying for next P/Y and will most likely have another german as HF has german family members."
3614214,Great.
3614208,All is god with AP and HF..HD realized they forgot APs birthday and they were very upset about this. HF is away on spring break and will be home in a few days. No concerns with AP
3614181,Everything is going well.
3614177,"They are doing really well. Gearing up for Spring Break.  They are going to Florida to visit friends and are all excited.  Michelle is also taking another trip this month.  They have been busy with Spring holidays, breaks and school."
3614175,All is good with the HF & AP - although AP is worried about a friend in Boston that is trying to rematch.
3614167,I asked Jason to fill out the medical consent form so Ellen can have a copy with her. Ellen is very talkative and very outgoing. She is very independent and seems confident with her job. She is driving the kids to and from school and activities. She has made friends with other aps in the neighborhood.
3614162,Met with HM and Tereza for the A/O on March 12th.. Discussed expectations and schedule. HM said that the kids warmed up to Tereza immediately and she instinctively knew how to engage them.
3614159,"very well.  New AP has arrived with Go America, from Thailand.  HF wanted another AP from Thailand and APC only had 2, so they ended up changing agencies.  HM said she already sees differences between the two agencies…..likes APC better.  AD told her they were welcome back at any time, we will miss having this family in our group."
3614155,Met with HM Teresa and Pia for the A/O. Reviewed expectations and schedule. Pia said that she is very happy here and glad to be a part of the family. Teresa said that things were going well with Pia.
3614144,"Met with HF and Bibi for the A/O. Reviewed expectations, rules and schedule. Naomi has been helping orient Bibi. The children have had a difficult time going to Bibi but she understands it will take tme for them to adjust especially with Naomi still here."
3614136,"good. No problems except the stomach flu. AP has not gotten it yet, but it seems to be running through the family."
3614128,HM says that all is good and Aylin is talking about extending - they are thrilled!
3614122,HD says that are good an enjoying this great weather
3614114,"spoke with Michelle, all good,will probably re-apply later this month and need next ap in August... will let Maike leave early since the girls are in camp and will fill out the form allowing that, will probably match at least 3 mos before the next ap arrives and would be eligible for the early match discount"
3614108,"all good, program is coming to an end with Nira, asked about itinerary and I wasn't able to open it but Nira should be able to see it in the ap room and can call me if she needs help with it, all rules are being followed, and no questions"
3614105,"spoke w th Jeffrey this month, the baby is doing well and things are good with Sahika, no questions and all rules are being followed"

3614097,"all really good, Karolina is fine, all rules are being followed, children are good and no questions, will talk again next month"
3614092,"about the same as before, the chores don't get done and unless the hf talks to her about it, should be automatic by now... if they decide to make a change they would rather do it at the end of the school year so it doesn't disrupt things too much... told them that they should keep in mind that if they make a change after the 6 month point it will be more costly for them since they would have to re-apply and get credit and new fees."
3614088,great they are very happy with her. She still isn't comfortable driving yet bit otherwise is doing well
3614073,HD says that AP is doing a wonderful job for the family and is handling the baby really nicely. He says that they got her a gift card to say how much they appreciate her to Cheesecake factory.He says that she has really become a part of the family and would love for her to stay one more year. He says that he will ask her soon if she would like to stay. AD discussed the extension process with HD. HD says that they are allowing AP to drive to and from school since her international has expired.
3614072,"AP has been going to a Gyn for bladder iproblem and HM says she has had to pay because AP does not have the money and UHC is not covering the office visit. HM is contacting UHC again to see what the issue is. HF have a good relationship with AP.. She is good with the baby and helpful around the house. She helps with laundry and cooking. She is very social, had a picture made with George Bush and has lots of friends. No quesitons at this time."
3614066,HM says that all is well and have no concerns.
3614055,HM is very happy with the program and recommended. AP is doing a great job and HM is happy that the both of them are doing things together and making friends.

3614033,"AP is doing great and had family, friends visiting"
3614031,HM stated they have a full house old AP is visiting. AP now is doing an awesome job.
3614026,AP had a great bday weekend in the Keys. AD explained to HM process to reapply for a new AP.
3613995,Things are great. We're doing potty training so kids have been a handful.
3613994,Everything is great.
3613991,Things are going well.
3613987,"Things are great, getting better all the time."
3613986,"AP is still crying daily.  AP says she is fine and has affirmed her desire to stay and do a good job on many occasions.  HM is getting frustrated / annoyed with the constant tears and no longer know what else she can do to help her.  She has included Nadia in every family event, has given her challenges and suggested she take walks, go out with friends, etc.  This weekend AP is with another south African in Vegas."
3613981,Everything is going well. The same.
3613944,Everything is really good and they all like Shiori ho is really sweet.
3613935,"AD met with HF in person for orientation and check in.  They are very pleased with previous AP, transition to this AP and beginning work of this AP.  They said that previous AD spent all last week training AP and that they will begin reviewing information with her this week"
3613907,"HF emailed about the fact that they saw Laura sola vera on the list of Au pairs in the area. I told them that Laura is in the area and that Laura has no ill intent for them or their new AP. They were intiallay angry that Laura got to rematch in the area, AD explained many times that is out of our control as to where the APs match, and that matching is often initiated by the HF's. In this case the new HF asked to be matched with Laura. etc. the HF were then upset that they had not been told of Laura's whereabouts and I told them that perhaps I should have told them that right away, but things happened and I actually forgot ( which is true). Sometimes there are a lot of details and also, since they had not yet gotten their new AP when Laura matched with the Merrill family, it got a bit lost as being of importance. They have calmed down, but are a bit upset still about the whole old AP issue. They mistakenly had been told by their current AP, Mariana, that someone on the playground had seen an old nanny neglecting their kids etc. I have spoken to Mariana that such information can really upset a Hf and that we do not want them stuck in the past and upset about things that might be blown out of proportion. Mariana totally understands this and also doesnt want them to be upset. She is doing good and that is all good. AD has informed HF to now rest assured that they have a new great AP and that the past ought to stay in the past. The Hf has told AD that they want to escalate this situation."
3613903,Monia s doing wel. She is leaving after a year so we aretrying to find a new AP. Has a boyfriend. Taking er to Disney land soon.
3613900,very wel so far. She is staying with Laura while we are in HAwaii for a eek.
3613868,"All is well as usual , HM says they have no issues or question."
3613851,Well- celebrating Raymond's 3rd birthday!
3613834,AP and HF are doing well in first week. Kids like the AP and she is communicating well with parents. AP is going out for driving this weekend. Will meet some of the other APs in area.
3613828,AP is doing great. Making many friends and looking forward to new Sammamish arrivals. No concerns at this time.
3613826,very well-- settling in now that family has left; pleased with how things are going-- working to establish good communication
3613775,well
3613774,well
3613764,HF has concerns with the match at this time.  The AD is going to the home on 3/15 to talk with both the HF and AP together
3613753,Really good!
3613741,very good
3613724,very well. Speaking with AP about extending.
3613700,"Very well- Melissa is almost done with her Spanish class.  When AD called Melissa and Veronica and Lea were skyping with Yuliya, the former AP.  All is well!"
3613695,Complaints because she wants her AP Diana to do more cleaning. I sent she and Diana the Light Housekeeping document. Diana is in compliance but Ary would like daily vacuuming. I explained that is outside the scope of an au pairs duties.
3613689,very well
3613674,"Everything is going well, they are really happy with AP. Son is potty trained and started preschool two mornings a week. AP does a great job with son and baby."
3613638,AD and HM met to discuss school districts.  Hm updated AD on AP.  AP is doing an excellent job.  Her family was here to visit.  Her sister stayed at the house and parents stayed in a hotel.  HF enjoyed meeting her family AP has been a good friend to a new AP in the area
3613599,"Pretty well.  Nina and I had a long conversation today about how Maira's doing.  She said that Maira is not the kind of au pair who is self motivated.  Nina is very busy right now with travel, etc. and gave me a couple of examples of how Maira just stands there and watches her when she's juggling the kids, the house, etc.  Nina has had to be very direct.  Maira takes direction well - no attitude, but she just doesn't have a lot of skills with regard to anticipating how she can help.  She gave Matthew a bowl of gummy vitamins the other day.  Nina called poison control.  Nina also said Maira is not the greatest driver.  They are going to have her practice all this weekend because Nina needs help next week.  She and the HD have been doing all the driving up to now.  Nina will see how things go.  If they don't see steady improvement she said I will be hearing from her."
3613560,"Calls, email to HM who states that all is well."
3613556,"Calls email, HM states all is well."
3613543,Overall it is working but there are some issues that come up. They have talked through everything and let some things go if it doesn't need to be discussed. She passed her driving test.
3613522,"HC who has cystic fibrosis is in the hospital so things have been a bit hectic. HM is very happy with AP. HM said that she is young but so mature and ""solid"" for her age. HM says the children really like her as well. AP has expressed that her placement does not even feel like a job. HM reassured her that the summer months will feel more like a job and its just the time of year that is ""light"" with activity."
3613513,s/w HM - said everything is going great and no issues - adv her i saw she reapplied and was happy to see that - she then went to say she think she will not go thru with APC - i asked why and if there was another agency contacting her - she said no but she is not sure what she is going to do - i met with AP at event Sunday and found out that a friend of hers is staying with the HF and I think they may see about having her stay with the HF - adv her to let me know if anything else needed or if changes her mind
3613510,It is going much better. They have had a lot of long task with AP and everyone is in a better place. She is hanging around more. We talked about next Aap and I told Hm about the early match disount. They may take a short break between APs as they might do a vacation in the Fall.
3613508,"spoke with Debbie, she said the babies dad was able to come back early from his deployment so he is in the area now with the baby. (their son in law) they are all doing well. Elif i traveling right now."
3613505,"AD spoke to HM. HM and HD are concerned about the AP's perception that they are being unfair with the weekly schedule as the HF starts the week on Sunday and ends it on Saturday. HM says that she and her husband met with the AP the other night, the meeting did not go as well as they had hoped. AD offered to come out to meet with all parties. HM will follow-up with an email about their availability for next week."
3613489,Things are not going well. HM told me a long list of things that have happened over the last few months including AP leaving the kids in the car to run into the store and left it running and forgot to out it into park and the car started rolling and one of the kids had to jump up to put on the brake. She also took the kids to the family fun center and instead of watching them and playing with them sat and painter her finger nails. AP is absent minded and HM feels she has had the last straw. She has cut her hours down to just a few a day because she can't trust her with the kids. The kids behavior has gotten really bad and they even hit AP. She doesn't have control over them and HM is strongly considering a rematch.
3613484,Everything continues to be great. HM was on her way to the dmv.
3613476,All is going very well.  HM a little disappointed that we do not offer a 3 month extension.   AD explained to HM that there is not a lot of demand for 3 month extension and that the cost would not be beneficial to HF's.
3613474,Everything is great. AP has family staying with HF at the moment. She is making their life easier and the girls love her.
3613470,"HM very happy so far with AP.  Paola is doing great and her daughter really likes to play with her.  Baby is easy as too young to really need a lot of running after, etc.  HM feels comfortable going back to work."
3613468,"Courtney reports that everything is going great, I reminded her about the early bird promo, checked if they are thinking about getting a new AP. Courtney said that she will speak with her husband and decide, she said that the program has been great for them, she just don't know if she can match by March 25th. No concerns"
3613465,AP is doing much better and HM is really glad it has all worked out. They are all going to Disneyland the first week of April and bringing AP.
3613451,"HD contacted AD.  Grandmother is on her last few days on this earth and HD wanted to know if it was appropriate to bring AP to wake and funeral.  AD suggested he openly ask AP what she would like to do and not force her, but if he needed her to watch children during that time, she did have to work, but not necessarily at the funeral home, etc."
3613441,"HM cell 206 787 0089 Its been a bit of a struggle at times. AP seems to say only negative things about boys and what they did wrong, not the positive things. Also ap was asking about having use of a car as has ap friend. HF have spoken with her about issues and seems to be a bit improved. Siad I would chat to ap too."
3613438,Everything is great and they're very excited that AP is now extending for another year.
3613435,HM is not happy with how things are going and is considering ending the match. She had questions about vacation time and feels AP is trying to work the system by adding vacation days to the weekend. I told her that I usually encourage APs to combine their weekend off with vacation if it works for the HF. She feels AP doesn't pick up on things quickly such as not knowing how the blinds work or getting the kids laundry mixed up. She thinks that AP needs more of a loving HF and HM is more down to business. We spoke about APs curfew of 10pm on the weekends and I told her that this was pretty unusual for an AP and gave her examples of what other HFs do. I told HM that if she tries to match with another AP it might be difficult with such and early curfew. HM will talk over with her husband about next steps and if she would like me to come do a mediation.
3613433,"Good no problems. Gamze is happy to have use of a car and has made a couple friends, also looking into classes."
3613424,Everything is great. She is going to talk with AP about extending which they are planning on doing and scheduling her last class. The kids are adjusting well and she is finding a good balance. She has a friend who may be interested in the program.
3613421,Great.  They are getting along well with Fany although Fany had a tough day today with the kids as they were testing her an not being respectful.  We talked about this being a normal part of the childrens' adjustment and she also noted that the kids were off today because of various other activities going on.  Shannon said that Fany is driving and is an excellent driver.
3613416,"Good, no issues. Back in family room and interviewing potential au pairs. DSaid to let me know if they had any questions."
3613379,"Spoke with HD, placement is going well. They are extremely happy with AP Nancy. Says she will be searching for a new replacement family soon and they will do all they can to help her and give her a good recommendation, etc. Otherwise, nothing to report...AP had considered going to doctor this past week for UTI but said it is getting better so she will not at this point."
3613372,Charlotte does what is expected and is good with the kids.  Sheila expressed that Charlotte does what is expected but no extra.  She does not seem interested in family functions.  Did not attend the children's birthday parties.  She seems very quiet and avoids the family on the weekends.  All this said Sheila is okay with Charlotte because she is doing a good job with the children.
3613361,Things are going well. I have done the APO and HM feels AP is adjusting well.
3613354,"AP going with HF to Florida for spring break. AP will be working. HF gave AP the option to work or take vacation. AP will take vacation at a later date. Aunt and boyfriend coming sometime in the Spring. AP does enjoy going out currently and is social. HF does not always feel AP is here for the right reasons. HF considering other countries other than Germany for next AP however driving, English and kind are important qualities ."
3613347,HF and AP are going to extend and AD sent the links and gave deadline and travel information.
3613341,HM is doing and feeling well. They are all adjusting to the new baby but he is growing fast and doing well. Older brother and sister are very excited and Marumi is a big help. They are interviewing for second AP and hope to find someone soon.
3613340,HM is doing and feeling well. They are all adjusting to the new baby but he is growing fast and doing well. Older brother and sister are very excited and Marumi is a big help. They are interviewing for second AP and hope to find someone soon.
3613318,"AP is doing well, children like her and she spends a lot of time with the HF. AP has not found any classes yet and HM said they are all over $500 so AD explained AP should look at the continuing education classes. AP likes to take Spanish."
3613279,Lori said that things are great with Atsumi. They have been getting travel updates for their next au pair's arrival as well.
3613274,Kate said her family and Paola are great this month.
3613255,Going well.
3613233,Sandy is doing well.  She is proactive with the children and even found a song that helps Liam not cry when Becky isn't around.  They are looking into a smaller car for Sandy to have.
3613225,"Grandma from Argentina is visiting, had kids in soccer camp, but also AP has been helping a lot."
3613220,Great.
3613214,All is well. HF is still interviewing and the interveiws are going well. I reminded them of their 3/20 match deadline.
3613212,Great.
3613210,HM said that things have been much better lately and her communication with the AP has gotten better. HM agreed that It must be the last 5 months of the extension year that makes it difficult in the relationship. HM said that the move went very smooth and that AP has been sincerely helpful.
3613209,"HF in rematch, but things with current AP are going fine."
3613197,Heidi says that Hanna is great and doing well - she is very sweet and is doing a good job with the babies.  I am going on Monday for the  APO.  Heidi is going to Germany and Hanna will go with her for the vacation.
3613179,"HM is getting sick and probably picked it up from her kids, AP is taking classes HM loves her and they don't know how they will be able to replace her."
3613091,Same. no problems. HF is helping her make a video for her profile.
3613090,Spoke with Hd and everything us good. In the process of interviewing. Has spoken to a couple of candidates.
3613020,HM is worried AP might be getting depressed and sad.  AD and HM talked about AP getting into classes as a social outlet.
3612994,"HF just got back from ""Big Bend"" national park. Had a great vacation. No problems to report."
3612975,HF and AP are doing well. HD was at nursery school event and will call back later.
3612964,HM stated everything is going really nicely.  HM stated she is very happy with everything especially considering they had a very difficult week.  AP seems to be in a nice groove now.  HM stated she thinks AP's adjustment period was just much longer than most AP's.  HM stated AP is excited about friend who is coming to visit in April and excited about Spring.  HM wanted to know why she paid APC $200 less in 2013 than in 2012.  AD stated that it was likely a special discount or referral fee but HM asked if AD could find out.  HM will email exact amounts.
3612946,Spoke to Hm and everything is going well. Hm thinks Ap is great. Ap has also been making friends and Hm is glad about that as she is getting out.
3612944,"HD mentioned Not so great! AP does not seem to be able to follow basic instructions. Does not wash dishes properly and leaves soapy residue in babies sippy cup, is extremely untidy and messy they have mentioned to her to keep her area clean time and time again.   Had an incident where the baby was not fastened properly into her car seat, the list just continues on, to top it all off last week she reversed into another car denting the other car and then drove off and left the scene. The owner of the other car she backed into had time to write down the company name on her car (the family and the AP share a company vehicle) and the owner of the damaged car called the HD. The AP denied it all and the HD seems to think she either has serious memory issues or just consistently lies whenever there is a problem and doesn't handle the situation very well.  I suggested going over there to conduct a mediation to see if we could resolve some of their issues and just waiting to hear back from the HF on what day next week is good for them to meet!"
3612914,AP is doing well.  A little timid and soft spoken.  AD spoke to family about  her being a little more assertive with kids overall.
3612900,Everything is better.  The first week in April HF is driving to KS to spend 3 weeks with HD.  Plan is to come back mid-April.
3612895,"Good. Susan's husband Greg is out of town for a month for work, so having the extra hands of an AP around is quite helpful."
3612891,it is going well and they will miss Julie. AD told HM that there is another great AP from Serbia close by. APs will overlap for several days.
3612889,"Amy said everything was going well.  The girls have adjusted much better than she thought they would.  Amabile's English is weak, so communication is sometimes difficult, but otherwise she is very sweet and they are doing well."
3612882,"Placement is going very well. HM said this is perfect match they are happy to have Karen in their live. She's absolutely amazing, funny, caring , meeting their personal level . They feel like they know her for long time . HM said Karen already went out with some AP. They will drive her to AP meeting this Sunday . AD offered to bring her home . ""As soon as Karen receive her social security card she will get Ohio driver's license."
3612874,HM stated everything is good. HM mentioned that they think they might want to extend with AP if she can complete her education.  HM stated that AP is dragging her feet when it comes to taking classes (as she also mentioned in our Feb. MC).
3612866,"AD spoke to HD, that was very upset that AP gave the HC adult cold medicine, without calling the HD or HM to even let them know the child was sick..  HD is calmer today but very upset last night , he will talk it over with his wife and the AP tonight now that they are all calm. HD asked about ending the match, AD went over the different options.  AD will follow up on Monday"
3612859,"Placement is going well.  HM received clear scan after radiation, now working on getting thyroid levels set.  HD was in car accident--car was totaled--he is having PT and dr. apptments to recover."
3612858,"Things are wonderful, the AP is best AP they have had an truly is a part of the family.  HM let me know she heard from her House keeper her last AP ended a 2nd match. HM was not surprised."
3612844,Good
3612836,"Great, AP is flexible with her time and spends alot of off time with HF."
3612795,"Hm reported that they are very happy with the AP.  AP was able to get DMV to allow her to get drivers license, but then didn't pass written test.  She will try again next week."
3612787,HM says AP's new extension HF wants her to leave on 4/9.   HM said she would think about this.  HM asked who is responsible to pay transportation to new HF.
3612776,"Everything is well. I e-mailed HM earlier this month informing extra discounts for re-applying family, but HM told me today they plan to get a new Au Pair."
3612764,"The family is struggling with the Au pairs driving and language. I encouraged them to allow her a lot of practice to drive and were going to followup after the wkd,"
3612752,"Everything is going well. John said Luisa has been doing a great job potty training the kids. HD mentioned that they started to mention during conversations about extension, but that Luisa doesn't seemed to be considering. HD says he is happy with AP program and would probably re-apply,"
3612749,"Everything is going great. HM mentioned possibility of family moving to California, but she said is just an idea for now."
3612745,"Everything is absolutely perfect at their house. Cata going home to Columbia for vacation and is super excited about it, reminded hm to be sure she has all her paperwork.  HM apologized about not getting back to me right away she has a new phone and doesn't know how to work it."
3612737,"Great, AP is doing fine.  Talking on phone with AP can be a challenge, I asked HM to text her instead whenever possible.  I asked if she knew why AP doesn't come to any more events, she said she didn't know.  AP is not usually working on Sundays."
3612730,The placement is going well. The families nanny has given her notice so we talked about the adjustment that is going to happen. She is busy interviewing for a replacement. they family is very happy with the Michaela.
3612717,grea we are vey happy with Jess
3612716,Very well.  I spoke with Ellen and she will be taking a leave of absence this summer to stay home with the boys.  Charlie will be starting PreSchool next Fall so they really do not need 45 hours of childcare each week.  For now they are not looking for a new AuPair.
3612710,great happy with Nail. no poblems.
3612705,well
3612661,Everything is great!  They really love Susi.  They want to extend wit her and will apply as soon as the 8th month has passed.  they are all going to Mexico Mat 26- 30.  Susi would like to meet more Americans and we discussed possible ways to do that.     .
3612654,"Fine.  The boys and Maxine are healthy for the moment and are really enjoying the warmer weather.  Maggie would like any help I can give for selecting a new AuPair.  She has Text Julie also asking for her help.  All of us, Ginny, Julie and I have tried to help."
3612650,Laura is good with the kids sand is oding a good job.  The accident is really causing problems.  The insurance company dropped Laura from the policy - she does not have her California driver's license.  They are trying to find some kind of insurance.  Laura failed the Driving test ad is taking the again this week.
3612647,Very good.  Jeff and Alicia would like to extend with Johanna.  They are very pleased with all the help Johanna provides.  Elle and Max love her and Jackson is very content.
3612635,I is going well from her point of view.  She still has questions about doing things just right.  One item was about helping n the kitchen after dinner at night.  I told her to start having a weekly meeting with Johana and walked her through doing it in a positive way.  They are going to continue to have issues if she doesn't meet on a regular basis.
3612626,Things are going well with te kids.  Lisa has some concerns though.  Natasha is staying out later now - often.  Lisa is worried about the car.  I suggested that they put a curfew on it.  I also said they could put a curfew on her too if need be.
3612619,They are all good.  Everything goes well and they are busy planning for their summer trip to Europe.  Yolanda goes with them.
3612615,"HM reports that all is well, she said that Baby Levi loves the au pair, and they have an open communication which she thinks is good, she said that AP is very open and they resolve any issues by tali=king about it and her English is very good."
3612614,"Very well.  AP sometimes loses patience with the HC, but HP are working with her.  HP think they might want to extend 9 months with AP but haven't talked to her about it yet.  HD and I talked about AP's school, I mentioned the weekend program for other cities and he went online and got excited there was one coming up in May in San Diego.  That would work very well with HP's schedule.  I told HD I would talk about it with AP."
3612610,"Everything is good.  They are happy.  When Viky leaves in May, they will be without help for2 1/2 months.  So, Tatjana will take the children to Europe for part of the time and Grandparents will visit and help for a few weeks as well."
3612604,Everything is good with them.  They are finishing up the Girl Scout cookie sale.  The family enjoyed the 2 German previous au pairs visit.  They will all go to Vegas for a week at the end of March.
3612598,Everything is going well from her point of view.  She is pleased.   Camila passed her written drivers test and has scheduled her driving test in 4 weeks.  They paid for a 2 hour driving lesson for her. So now she will  go out on her own.  She has been very helpful for Rachel. .
3612588,The problem has been resolved.  I went to the family home after Cecilia told me they had definitely decided to end the match.  I asked both sides about their concerns.  Both were very moved by the conversation.  Cecilia kept saying how wonderful Denisa was with the girls and that she wanted to make sure that Denisa could rematch..  And the baby  kept wanting to go to Denisa .  I explained that I would talk with Denisa every day to help her.  Also she would easily match as she is a very good driver.   A few hours later I received an email saying they had a long talk and had changed their minds.  They wanted her to stay.  The Dad called e the next morning and said they had misjudged her mistaking shyness for disinterest.  They talked enough to be comfortable with each other.
3612565,HM was very upset with AP when she saw her phone bill. AP has been texting a large amount while caring for their daughter.  HM and AD discussed this at length and AD advised talking to the AP about rules of computer and phone while watching her child.  HF is bringing AP on vacation for a week to St. Martin.
3612562,HM has asked AD to speak to AP about getting her new visa.  HM says that AP is very anxious due to hitting many roadblocks in talking to the American embassy in France.  AP is due to get a new visa in July when she returns to France for her extension year.  AD will reach out to AP to see what assistance AD can offer.
3612545,melissa says their match is going really well; she has some questions about taxes which we discussed.
3612513,"HM says that she is very concerned that either a language barrier exists or AP is just not ""getting it"" and doesn't seem to have common sense. She says that she has been crystal clear with AP and has written down the schedule, discusses each item on the schedule/asks if AP has any questions, emails the schedule that was discussed with her, prints out the schedule and posts it on the refrigerator. HM says that she adores AP but says that she is not understanding/grasping what the family's needs are. HM says that AP gets things done with a lot of direction and patience. She says that she has been spending too much time explaining and re-explaining each item with AP and says that things are getting much more difficult when they should be getting easier.  She says that AP doesn't prepare or plan and seems to be clueless each day of her duties. She says that the kids have already lost respect for AP because they say she doesn't understand anything. HM says that she really wants the match to succeed,  but she doesn't have time or energy at this point to do anymore. AD let HM know that AD will come out to the house to discuss with both parties."
3612495,"Things with Ali, good. Alex is now out of hospital from brain surgery and is doing well. Got my card. Ali decided not to extend which they are sad about. Discussed in country and out of country matching. HF are just reticent about committing to full year and finances."
3612479,"HD says the month has been very smooth.  HF and AP are communicating well and ""checking in "" daily to make sure everyone is working together.  AP got her SS# and bank account.  AP will take her drivers license test on Monday.  AP has met a few friends in the area and is getting out socially It has been a rough week as HD grandmother passed away in Poland and AP's grandmother is sick"
3612472,"going really well, they love Angela. she is doing great with the kids. The took her on a test drive and she is a good driver, they say she is very pleasant to live with."
3612466,HF is disappointed AP will not be extending with the family because it has been such an excellent year but HF understands AP desire to return home.  AP is helping HF review AP candidates.  HF has had a good month
3612460,"HM said she is really good with the girls as far as keeping them in line., responsible and timely. concerns about completing homework with the girls."
3612457,"going fine, no changes. she helps with homework etc."
3612452,"going well, Carolina is doing great with the kids and they are working on the driving."
3612448,"Very well.  They are enjoying spending time with AP, and she's good with the HC.  AP's last class is April 3, then she will decide whether or not to extend with HF.  They really want her to.  They are taking her to La Quinta on Spring Break in April.  They are also going to Disneyland for a few days coming up."
3612440,"(AP said she is doing very well and is very comfortable with HF. 'very good communication"" ""kids are very nice w/ me"") Sandra says it is still hard to read Claudia so they are glad she says good things. Sandra said what ever I said To AP recently has really helped as she has purposed to be more involved with the family staying and talking with Sandra for 20 min after dinner. Sandra complimented her saying it was great to get to know AP better.."
3612439,"Spoke with Mark. All is great.   I let him know he needs to submit his extension paperwork by April 1st.  He is waiting on a credit card from his wife's work, as they pay for childcare, somewhat. Had a great time in Hawaii."
3612419,Spoke with HM. She went with AP to court today. See notes. Things are going well with AP except this is exhausting and stressfull. AP has been able to get around and out with friends.
3612414,"all well - happy with AP - HC likes her - she'd good with him, no issues"
3612412,"Great, no problems.  HD was getting ready to board a plane, so the call was short.  I asked him about the vacation question and he said he had worked out a solution with the AP and everyone was satisfied with it."
3612408,"Spoke with Jenn. She said that Bia fell down the steps and sprained her ankle. She can weight bear and it isn't swollen. She didn't work yesterday and didn't want to work  today. Jenn told her that she would need to go to the doctor if she couldn't work Jenn said that she kept encouraging Bia to put ice on her foot and she wouldn't.  Jenn said that she is feeling better today and is working. Jenn is worried that Bia hasn't signed up for her second class yet but is interested in a class at Burlington County Community College. The class is in NJ and is over an hour away. In addition, the class is in the evening and that is when Bia is supposed to work. Jenn feels guilty but Bia works very few hours and the evening is when she is needed. They settle on the new house tomorrow and are moving next week. Their new address is: 304 Mallwyd rd Merion Station. Jenn said that she and Michael are willing to keep Bia until June as they don't want her to miss her vacation that she has already scheduled."
3612399,"Everything is great, things are getting back to normal now that Nicole is back home but the kids have been sick all week which is tiring for everyone.  Advised hm about New America College TOEFL class for AP's next education."
3612394,"Everything is great, they are in Boston, Yuka wanted to go to Boston for her birthday so she and the baby came with hm on this business trip.  They are at the Aquarium and hm is working!  They'll be home tomorrow."
3612389,"Spoke with Clarissa. Things are going well with Marina.  They are doing a lot of coaching in regards to Marina being more confident with the kids. Her driving is very cautious and the family asked me whose responsibility it would be for driving lessons.  I let both the AP and HF know that it would be the HF's responsiblity.   But, I mentioned that its good peace of mind to have an objective trainer assess Marina regarding skill set and knowledge of the rules.  She agreed."
3612338,well
3612330,HM enjoying working closer to home.  HD is away this week so was not affected by train trouble.  HF taking AP to FL on Saturday and things are hectic getting ready.  HM said she would talk to AP about getting her credits done.

3612087,"Everything is going great with Mery, don't mention this to my parents but I think I trust Mery being with little Michael more than my mom. Kidding aside she has been a blessing and will be taking care of another little guy later this year as I'm 4 months pregnant with our second!"
3612084,Ok.
3611980,HM says transition with new AP is going very well.  HM said she was not happy with their LCC from CC so they got a new one who is better.  HM said she just got into car accident but everyone is okay.
3611968,HF and AP are finalizing the extension application and AP is sending her forms.
3611946,"Cami lied to Ron last night , telling him that he & Sara were going to the mal, when in fact , she dropped Sara off at the mall ,then came back near the house to meet a guy. During this trip, she had a auto accident. Doug was upset and told her to stop lying, as she does often. She then told him the truth . There was another event, when she said she was going to the mall with the car when a situation occurred & they found out the she went to Bethlehem instead. Cami then said that she went to pick up a friend & mislead them. The other day, she was driving & posted a picture on Facebook of the traffic, when she was driving.  Cami continues to lie to them to a point where they no longer trust her with the kids ,they do not feel they are safe in her care.  Last week prior to the car accident, they brought their parents up to stay with the kids. Cami puts her needs first and the kids are left unattended while she takes calls, including a call to me to see if I could get a ticket for her friend to see Momma Mia. Nikki was working fro home that day. The girls came to her to tell them they were hungry. Cami had gone to her room & closed her door to be on the phone with me for over a half an hr. while I searched my emails for the group sales contact # & called to secure a ticket for her friend. She then went on to bad mouth me to Sara. Nikki said that she lied to Sara about me & had no response when Nikki asked her to elaborate. Nikki pulled Sara as side to suggest she take Cami's negative claims with a grain of salt and use her own determination of me ,told Sara she can trust & count  on me for support. Nikki also talked of another situation ,where Cami continued to pout in front of the kids, insisting Ronnie change his mind ,after he had said no to something.Then walked around with an attitude in front of the kids. Cami has also taught the girls cuss words in Spanish."
3611941,good.
3611909,"Everything is going well, hm has had to help ap along wth taking initiative which she hasn't had to do before, but she thinks she is finally beginning to understand that hm wants her to make playdates and take the kids places.  They have their court date today for the accident and hm is going to go with her.  AP also got a camera speeding ticket right after the accident, so hm had to sit her down and tell her, she needed to get the driving issues under control.  If AP can't drive, hm can't keep her, 90 % of the job is driving!  HM will let me know if any other issues arise, but she feels they are on track and things are going much more smoothly."
3611885,Things have improved since we last met and we are still monitoring Dani. Overall it is better around their house.

Example, baby had diarrhea this morning and she woke up HD about it instead of  just cleaning up the baby.  Ap is itching to drive and is asking a lot to be taken out driving and many times it is obviously not a convenient time. I suggested having a meeting this weekend and start it with all the good things AP has been doing then move into things AP needs to work on. I also suggested going over the weekly schedule with AP on Sunday and discuss which days would be good to practice driving or good days to be able to drop AP off some place."
3611832,"Hm thinks everything is going ok, she's beginning to think 2 years is a bit too much.  They've decided not to get somebody else for a few months after Mari goes.

Grandparent said it is okay we will just wrap the seat belt around the car seat and it will be fine.  The HM was angry that the AP did not speak up for herself and go inside for the other.

Kathy asked me how she should proceed with regard to Meghan's plans to stay once her program is over.  We've talked about this before and I let her know that Meghan can change her visa if that's what she wants.  It has no bearing on the HP and I told her she could give Meghan advice or wait unti she asks for it.  Things are going well.   We also talked about what they would look for in their next au pair.

She is not picking up after the girls or putting folded laundry away as required. Kim let duties slide because Nina was so great with the girls. Reminded her that its harder to pull in the reins once an au pair has so much freedom. Kim is second guessing her ability to be a good host mom. Asked her to check in after talking to Nina.
3610202,Everything is going well. Nothing to be concerned about.
3610193,HM called AD to ask advice about how much info AP should provide prior to going out for the evening.  AD recommend that AP let HF know where she will stay if spending entire evening out.  HM was concerned that AD had given her phone number to a stranger.  AD suggested HM sit down with AP and explain the danger of giving phone number to strangers.  HM agreed and she will have this conversation immediately.  HM is very pleased with AP but wants to ensure she is making smart decisions.  Hm will give AD update after conversation HM says she would like AP to practice english more often.  HM says AP is extremely quiet  and usually spends off hours with other Asians.  AD recommends that HM encourage AP to attend monthly socials.  AP needs to meet other AP's in the cluster.  HM agreed and will encourage her to attend upcoming socials

3609957,HM called because she is concerned about AP's health. He has been sick and she wanted him to rest and see a doctor. She's worried that he is going out too much and not taking care of himself which could affect his job performance. I gave her insurance information and advice on how to express her concerns to AP.
3609953,Everything is great with Hina and she has one week left. I called HM to remind her to apply. She applied while we were on the phone and I let her know that I would contact Misaki about her application.

AP just needs to decide.  AD explained process, deadlines and early bird discount if they don't extend.  AD also mentioned that AP needs to finish courses before deadline.  AD will email information on extending."
3609673,Well.  HM states all is going well - no other issues with the AP at this time.  She is trying to ensure the AP has the night off for our monthly meeting.  No concerns at this time.
3609671,Dana said that all is going well this month with Ana.

3609613,Michaela is doing well. HM is looking forward to having the summer off from hosting an au pair. She isn't sure what she is going to do next year. But is leaning toward maybe having an extension AP
3609543,"Still the same. Personalities just do not gel and AP does mediocre job, doesnt show much initiative and had trouble disciplining kids. HM would like to schedule an exit meeting as feels things just aren't working out. Scheduled for Thursday."
3609515,"Everything going great, she's going on vacation for 2 weeks on east coast, hm is helping, Evan is doing better, threatened to send him off to his dad's and that seemed to straighten him up a bit.  HM will check on her school.  AP is hanging out with them more than any ap ever has except maybe for Robert and kids see her as a family member not ""help""."
3609514,"Long chat with HM. Paulina good as usual.Seems like she has finally decided to extend with different family. She is going to Poland In June for 2 weeks when girls are at horse camp, so works out well. Talked about being back in family room and interview questions as well."

They do worry if she has enough friends, but she seems happy and hm has told her to let her know if she needs anything.  Advised hm I'll keep an eye on the deadlines as she is done with school here end of March."
3609498,Ale is dong a great job.  Halle and I discussed Ale extending with the family.  We also discussed Ale's visa expiring in June and her program year ending in September.  We discussed that Ale would need to travel home (if she extends) before June due to the visa issue.  Halle also stated that it was Ale's birthday yesterday and they took her to dinner and had a special video sent from her parents.
3609496,"Calls, email and discussion re: childcare, family all is okay"
3609495,Good on home stretch now and winding down. Thinks Annika leaves on 5 April and then doing a bit of travelling. New AP Julia arrives following week and they will all go to Jamaica for week. Scheduled oi for as soon as they get back.
3609483,"ALl is going very well with Tess, they just love her, wish she would stay longer, but she needs to go home. HM has been looking but with no luck.  She is looking on the general website and then through family room and its not the same people.  AD explained that she cannot interview an au pair who does not have the under 2 qualifications.  Asked HM to contact Jeff for help"
3609456,"Jaime reports that she's not ready to ""throw in the towel"" yet, as she sees a lot of potential in Bela; however, she admits that Bela is not progressing the way she'd like, in the ways of being assertive, authoritative, and being a commanding disciplinarian that is needed by Jaime for her three girls. She is working diligently with Bela on this. I suggested that she and HD sit down w/Bela and discuss how Bela feels about what is expected of her...can she do it? Will she do it? Does she want to, and if so, what can HM and HD do to help get her to where she needs to be?"
3609452,Very good. Candice really adores the baby and is very good with her. She is respectful and they have started weekly meetings. Candice has made a couple friends but not looked at classes yet. Researched a bit while she was still in France.
3609439,"All is great with Sabrina, HM wishes she would stay for a second year but AP promised her family back home she would only be gone for one year.  HM is going to put in a new application next week or this week if she can get to it."
3609434,They are doing very well and everybody is happy.  The girls just love Isabella.
3609433,HM told me that all is well.  Caryn might want to go back home in May for personal reasons for a quick trip and HM was wondering if he is ok with her J-1 Visa that she has renewed already when she first extended.  I replied that I don't think she sould have any problems.
3609417,HM says that all is great and they have no concerns.
3609413,"All is going very well, no issues at all with Rikako, she is doing fine and their daughter is happy. AD spoke with HD, who was very brief and did not say much."
3609398,Maria said they are doing well this month. They may go back to Mexico for Spring break but not sure yet. Penny is back in the US with a student visa so she will come to visit them and has become friendly with Jane. She gave Jane advice about taking Naya outside more and it seems that Jane and Naya have become closer recently which is great.
3609372,"HM says that she and HD sat down with AP since our discussion last month and things have gotten better. She says that AP still goes out, but not as often. She says that once the weather gets warmer they hope that AP plans on going on family trips with them. HM says this will be a test since they want their AP as a part of the family even during off time. She says that she is still doing an awesome job with the baby.  She says that she is going to begin helping AP to learn how to drive and get her permit. She says that she gave AP a deadline of the end of this week to let HM know what classes she is planning on taking. AD will discuss with with AP as well."
3609357,"HM struggling with AP.  AP is a nice person, but she is not on top of things.  Many small examples.  HM cooked dinner for AP and kids (HM went out) and AP left the pots and pans on the stove - when HM asked she stated she forgot.  HM asked AP to always let her know when she goes out with kids - AP did not do it a few times.  HM has asked AP repeatedly to study for the NJ driver's test as she cannot have a driver without the NJ license (due to past incident), and AP stated she will start soon.  HM also feels that AP is either lazy or just slow.  She had asked AP to never leave food out due to critters, but AP keeps doing it over and over, although there is a yellow sticky note to indicate to put food away.  AD and HM discussed what to do next and HM is going to sit down with AP and make a list of things that need improvement and things that need to be done, no discussions.  Also, HM is going to test drive with the AP and also see what she got on the written practice test.  If these things don't pan out, HM is probably going to ask for a rematch."
3609335,"HF thanked me (belatedly, she said) for the EM I sent to start their year out right. (see notes for AP) HM says so far she is energized and has done well for the first few weeks.HM does do pop ins every once in a while and she is teaching Eli colors and taking him for walks, she tends to be gone all weekend, her ""boyfriend"" comes to get her (he has a Ford F150 truck) and pays for her gym membership. she stops in once over the weekend sometimes, he lives downtown, She doesn't hang out w/ any AP's here. friends are: 1 guy going through a divorce and a girl who seems to have a lot of issues."
3609324,very good-This weekend HF will celebrate their wedding. AP is very good with children.
3609304,HM says that AP is doing a great job and they have no concerns.  HM says that AP is still studying for her driving test.
3609278,HF are moving to Chicago in June. We talk about school today for a long time.
3609244,"going great, she is going beyond our expectation. she is connected and part of the family"
3609232,HF just got back from Palm Springs for HM birthday. Lovely weather! All good with Carole. definitely not getting new ap. Asked if hf knew any local families that might want Carole and to keep her eyes open she said she would.
3609221,HM says that AP is doing really well and they have no concerns.
3609210,"Spoke with HM and things are wonderful. HC transitioned nicely, seems like AP has always been here.  Just picked up cell phone for Ap."
3609205,Spoke with Hd and things are good. There have been a couple of issues with schedules and he has sat AP down and has gone over what is expected. Hd's sister and staff is helping her thru process. Ap had accident with car that had extensive damage but there were no injuries. HD said he will not charge her the $250 deductible. HC love ap.
3609183,very good-I spoke to HM. She help AP organize his vacation.
3609181,"Everything is great with Alex, maybe a little awkward as hf is interviewing for her replacement and they would really love her to stay.  HF really want an experienced previous au pair due to their kids ages and stages right now.  Checked on Ivana from Czech with Ginny but didn't have under 2.  HM asked if this could be changed and I told her I didn't think so."
3609156,very good-We talk for a long today how wonderful is Laura. HM is nervous about the 2nd AP arrival but she told me today that our matching expert is fantastic.
3609152,Things were somewhat better however HD  are not sure the AP has maturity to meet the needs of their family. She is still focusing on boyfriend on weekends. She has had two car accidents that were her fault in the past two days and they feel she might have been texting while driving the kids. AD will speak to AP today;
3609149,Calls email and Arrival orientation conducted.  AP seems to be off to agood start and comfortable in family.
3609140,I received a call from the HM because the AP did not return home after going out on a date.  HM went down to check for the AP at 7:20 am and she saw that the AP had not come home.  She called the AP several times and finally received a text back stating that the AP was in a cab on her way home.  Hm told the AP that if anything like that happens again she will send her home.  AP apologized and I told the HM I would follow up and speak with the AP as well.
3609136,Spoke with Hm and everything is good. We had discussed Ap's last day and she will pick up the pace for interviewing new AP's.
3609126,"She called to say that she is again frustrated with Zulma, who seems to not be taking her job as seriously as they would like her to. Alice advised her to speak with Zulma about this to see if it worked. She will let me know what happens."
3609124,Spoke with Hd and everything is good. Ap will be extending.
3609106,Keith says that all is going well!
3609102,very good-AP arrived to Thailand March 7. She will be back next week.
3609100,Ruby quickly called me back to say things are going well. She has had two outstanding APs and thinks it will be challenging to find another. Just needs some time to search for her next selection.
3609090,"Calls, email to HM all is going well, the AP is doing a nice job and getting to know the children."
3609070,HF feels they are so lucky with their first wonderful AP. They are slowly getting the boys used to the idea that the AP will go home at the end of the summer. Went over timeline and when HF should start looking and AD advised April/May. Want the two APs to overlap for one week. HM may go back to work in a more regular/traditional job.
3609060,HD stated everything is the same.  HC is trying to watch her weight and eat healthy and AP has made a few insensitive comments.  HD said it's nothing that needs to be addressed and things have not gotten worse but they are ready for a change.  They won't need an AP anymore so they are adjusting to what that means for their family as well.  AD and HD discussed tax issue.  HD was glad AP went to tax meeting because she had a lot of questions. HD mentioned that HF is surprised AP has not improved but he thinks she is looking forward to going home and is excited about it so she's thinking about that more than about getting along with HF.
3609055,Spoke with HM and everything is going well. Ap has taken over position quite well and has made some friends.
3609043,Everything is going great as usual. I mentioned to HM that Buse hasn't attended any of the AP's meeting and asked her to facilitate so she can go to next one.
3609027,HM is still not sure this match will work.  Hm is still perturbed that AP cannot drive to the ability stated in her application.  HM said she asked several open questions about driving during the interview process (open ended question) and HM does not understand why she cannot drive better.  HM did say AP passed her drivers license.  HM and HF have driven with AP and are not comfortable with her driving the kids alone.  HM says she will give the match one more month.  This month they will put an extreme focus on practicing driving.  AT end of month HM will decide if the match will continue.  HM admits her personality and AP may not be the best fit.  HM says weekly meetings are being held and that HF and AP have opportunity to discuss anything at the meetings.  HM says AP has made  good friend in the cluster.  HM wants AP to attend the March social.  AD will continue to check in with HM this month.  AD will encourage AP to attend the social.  Hm admits the water damage continues to be a bit of a pain...HM said she has spent over 40 hours dealing with the damage and this has taken time away from her private practice
3609020,Spoke with Hm and everything is good. She will be speaking with AP about extension. Discussed extension deadline. Also asked Hm to make sure AP contacts AD.
3609019,"HM stated that there need to be some adjustments with the AP.  AP was a little withdrawn this past week which could be from homesickness or the fact that HM is out of town and is the only French speaking family member so HF needs to talk to her about that.  HD had a good conversation with her this morning about a few things AP had forgotten to do.  AP gets along really well with HC but HM stated that AP needs to understand that her ability to communicate with them is as important as her ability to do the job.  HM stated she is optimistic about the placement and they just need to work through a few issues like remembering to lock the door and shut the garage door.  HM stated this AP is not as warm as some of their other APs have been so the HF needs to adjust for that.  HM stated they just all need to find the right rhythm and they haven't yet.  HM stated that she had stayed out all night on a Saturday night which is something the HF doesn't want, but it didn't seem to be a positive experience for the AP so HM is hopeful it doesn't continue.  If it does, HM stated they might give her a weekend curfew. HM stated she would call AD when she returns to NJ to discuss issues in more detail.  AD asked for APs new cell number.  HM stated she would text it to AD after they hang up."
3609014,"I spoke with Howard Sunday and Autumn yesterday.  Autumn had to go out of town this weekend for work so Howard was there and he has concerns about Anna since the talk Thursday.  He said she went out with friends Saturday and he found a beer bottle in the driver's seat.  He also smelled smoke and went in her room, looked through drawers, and found a bud of pot.  Autumn said she is going to have a talk with Anna and wanted me to wait until after the talk to do anything.  She doesn't want Dani thinking this is ok, but Anna is really great with her daughter."
3609009,"Had lunch with Haley.  She said Nico did as she was told but nothing more, but everything was fine.  She was happy that she seemed to put up with the girl scout cookie sales and all just fine.  She says she monitors her and makes sure she is doing ok, but that she has had a hard time getting her classes done."
3609002,HM  thanked AD for calling and said all is well! Things are going great.
3608995,HM stated everything is great! AP is wonderful and they would love to extend with her but AP has not given them a decision yet.  AP's sister is visiting today and tomorrow so AP said she would give them a decision after her visit.  AD gave HM extension deadlines and early bird deadline if AP doesn't extend.  AD mentioned that AP has inquired about school issues and extension.  AD told HM we need to see how many hours she has already completed and how many she will have completed by June 1 and then we can make a determination or AP may need to take another course before June 1.  AD will speak with AP to confirm if she wants to extend and encourage her to discuss with HF.  HM stated they have a good relationship so they should not have a problem talking about it.  HM stated she would think AP would extend because next year will be easier because youngest HC will be starting Kindergarten.
3608985,AD spoke with HD who stated everything is fine.  AD asked if he felt AP's adjustment period was over and she was getting into a routine.  HD stated she had and he feels they have a good enough relationship they can all be very straightforward when things need to be followed through and they are working on that process constructively and everyone is getting along.  HD stated they have had no conflicts since her arrival.
3608977,"HM said that everything is great. HM thanked me for inviting them to the 3/9/14 St. Patrick's Day family dance party with a Latin twist. HM also said that AP won't be extending as she is returning home to Germany for school. HM asked me about the process for looking for a new AP, including the second year costs. HM said that they kind of ""rushed"" into matching with current AP Vivien and might want to revise their AP search criteria for next time around."
3608967,All is fine! Shannon will provide a photo for my newspaper article.
3608944,HM stated that AP has been taking over as mom and not allowing HM to discipline kids and butts in. AD suggested that she speaks to AP. HM never wants AD too but will think about it. HM stated AP has been short with boys and not having a lot of patience with boys yelling at them lately.
3608909,"HM Kelly returned my call on 3/8. All is going well. She feels big and will deliver in 2 months. Monika is wonderful and they will miss her terribly when she returns home, but that is not until October. HM wished me well on my vacation."
3608885,"They are doing really well.  She love Janaina and loves how happy her babies are.  She wishes that our group got together more, but not so that Janaina has more social time, but would love the au pairs to have playdates together.  There are a few things that we talked about...they do live pretty faraway, we also talked about other au pairs groups and chat rooms and Janaina putting herself out there to meet with other groups."
3608868,Monica said things are going fine.  She says that she will sign off on the early departure so Olga can fly to Spain first and then Monica will buy her a ticket to go to Italy with them from Spain.  Monica said that isn't what she wanted but Olga always works things to get her way.  I told her it might be better for Olga to drop off all her luggage first anyhow.    Monica also told me if Olga was too whiny about not wanting to leave them that she may have to send her home from Italy early and end things that way but she didn't want to.  She said Olga has been constantly talking to the girls about how she is leaving and keeps asking them if they'll miss her.  Monica says she doesn't like it because it is upsetting to the girls but also annoying because the girls don't really care.
3608853,"HM loves AP - just worried with her father dying & her bro-in-law's sudden death, that she will get really sad and go home. She tries really hard but her English is still not good. She does not ask enough questions. She spends lots of time with HF and just went to Las Vegas with them."
3608843,"HM said that the entire household, including AP Thais, was sick with the stomach flu, but they are on the mend now. HM thought that the AP/HF St. Patrick's Day party is this weekend so I told her that it was yesterday."
3608841,"HM Liam said that everything is good with current AP Ana. HD said that he would like to begin his search for a new AP as he doesn't think that current AP Ana will get her F1 student visa in time and he doesn't want to be without an AP. I encouraged HD to renew in Family Room, updating his AP search criteria, if needed. HD commented that he saw a ""scary"" AP with a big lip piercing. I told AP that once he renews on Family Room that our ME Ginny will help him with his search."
3608817,"March activity is too expensive, told her just  a get together for coffee, she thought it was skiing... I emailed the aps about skiing but it is not our monthly activity, just something some aps had asked about so I passed along the info... all good with the hf,no questions, will look for my emails"
3608816,"all good, got an envelope a while ago for Sophie May and sent it on to her and a notice about a package but didn't pick it up so it should have been sent back to sender... all good with Jing"
3608808,"check in call, everything is going well,no questions and all rules are being followed"
3608785,very good.

3608731,very well. HM is finishing up classes and HF will be traveling on vacation for Spring break with AP.
3608723,Spoke with Hm and everything is good. Getting ready to go on vacation to Disney. Ap has recently returned from trip home and was happy to see everyone.
3608717,very well.
3608697,very good.
3608687,very good. HF and AP just returned from a cruise. Had a wonderful time.
3608640,"HD is happy with AP. He would really like her to extend, but didn't talk to her about her decision yet. He will tonight. I told him he has to reapply now if he wants the early bird discount."
3608623,Julie had a few questions about the application for next year and when they should start the process of looking.  We talked about whether or not Belen would like to extend and Julie thought that she would not as she is anxious to get her career going - they will have the official conversation about that in a couple of weeks.  Things are going well and they are in a groove that is nice.  Hoping for some good weather soon - everyone is fed up with the snow.
3608617,Very well.  They are very happy with AP and how she interacts with the kids.  I thanked her for sending AP to the event yesterday.  HM asked if I had heard any more from AP's former HM and I told her that I had not.

3608524,"Marie said that they love Sara and they feel lucky to have her. She comes home to a clean home, that Sara does great with this, yet she expects things to be the way she wants them to be run in the home, rather than conforming to their lifestyle. Marie said when they spoke ,it was Sara telling her how she wants things to be run, leaving Marie upset with her. Marie did vent to HF De Vita, who told her AP, who old Sara. Marie admitted that when she gets angry, she calls Doug and he helps her to see things through from another perspective. I am meeting with Sara & Marie tonight to help them navigate to a better place. Doug did say that they like Sara a lot, that she is a great girl & wonderful with the kids.

She really wishes Nicola would stay and extend, but she says that Nicola wants to return home at the conclusion of her PY. She said she's going to try and talk to her more about it as time gets closer, and even suggest a 6 month extension.

HM says she has had very mixed feelings about AP, as noted in previous monthly contacts, so she is okay with AP's decision.  HM says she is still continuing to be frustrated at AP's apparent lack of common sense with certain issues.  AD offered again to come out and speak with she and AP but HM declined.  HM says she has also realized that she may not be the type of person that does well having others live in her home."

She said she is happy to have her stay until her year ends but they won't need the help after her husband gets back.  She said she wanted to make sure she can find another family with no trouble.  We talked about the education requirement and the aupair extension application and the fee with it.  I told her what Michele would need to do to extend.

Then HM said that Kim started crying about leaving, etc. HM said that AP Kim is ""like a daughter to me"" and assured AP that she will always be part of ther family. AP also complained about feeling dizzy and wanted to see a doctor, so I re-sent AP Kim the nurse hotline and list of local doctors from the UHC website. HM asked me if the insurance covers any sort of counseling, so I re-sent HM the nurse hotline in order for AP to speak with a counselor. I also encouraged HM to ask AP to mention her anxiety to the doctor she is seeing this afternoon as well. HM and I agreed to reconnect after AP Kim goes to the doctor."
3607960,HM reports things are great and stated that she will call me if there is an issue

3607608,AD spoke to HM . HM due date is in one week she said she's super tired and Hana is a big help. She does everything HM asked her to do and HM feels like they have good relationship.

3607595,It is going well. HM said her tax advisor will help Lucie with her tax papers. Former AP Aneta has been in touch with Lucie and is complicating things with some of the information she is sharing. AD will carefully address this with AP.
3607589,AD talked with HD.  AP is going to Cancun from the 18th to the 26th.  I think HD is a bit frustrated because the AP is leaving a month early and didn't realize his wife agreed to this.  He would like her to do less texting and more working with her son on Spanish.
3607576,well. AP= HF are great. Kids adjusted easily. Everything went easily. HF had a nice weekend with the many sports and competitions.
3607557,"Calls, email and discussion.  AP is great witht he children, a bit relaxed about chores and family time in general.  HD feels that he is very supportive of AP and sometimes it is not retrned."
3607556,It is going well. HF is happy that after the more difficult start they are now in a good place. HF asked about new AP in August and they know that the AP wants to self extend. HF is going away Aug 15-end of August to Europe so they will look for a later arrival date.
3607551,things are going very well no concerns host mom had a question about education stipend.
3607544,Placement is going well. Winta is wonderful with the children. She has been on vacation past week. HD said she didn't give them good indication as to if she plans to extend with them or if she want's to extend at all.

3607522,Great
3607503,As well as HM expects.  AP and HF have settled into what is expected and what the AP is capable of delivering.
3607499,"Sarah reports that things are not well at all. She said that since Melanie has returned from Germany, she's been very difficult to live with. Sarah reports that Melanie has been disrespectful to Sarah, ""sassing"" her back and being rude in her conversations, mannerisms, body language. They have their old AP, Linda, visiting and staying with them until the end of the week, and they report that Linda has caught Melanie muttering obscenity under her breath and making ugly, disrespectful faces behind their backs when she walks away from a conversation with them. She has been rude, she's lied about where she's been going when going out w/friends, and at one point was so rude to host father that he called her out on it and she backed down. Sarah is unsure what caused this personality change-it could be that something bad happened in Germany or perhaps Melanie is upset that she's not found any HF's to match with, she's not sure as she's tried to gauge Melanie in conversation and she's just shut down. She retreats to her room or goes out, and does not engage w/the family anymore. She maintains that the childcare is still good, but even when receiving instructions for the day, she behaves rudely to Host Mom. Sarah basically said that she's had it, and at this point, she's ready to ask Melanie to leave. At this point, she honestly does not care where Melanie goes or where she stays. With Host father's parents here this weekend, and new AP arriving next week, she made it very clear that she can easily let Melanie go and still have childcare in place.   AD requested that Host Mom and Host Dad ask Melanie to have a family meeting asap, preferably tonight. It was suggested that they talk to Melanie about how they feel, and explain to her that her behavior is not appropriate. I also suggested that they ask her to explain to them why she's behaving this way. Host Mom plans to tell her that she's not happy with Melanie's behavior and that she has no problems asking her to leave if necessary. AD also told HM to let Melanie know that I am aware of her behavior, and that it's going to be put in her record, for other potential HFs to see.  HM is hoping that this meeting will ""snap"" Melanie back to reality and that she'll be better behaved for the rest of her time here. HM has said that if Melanie does not rematch right away after her end date of 3/28, that she can stay with them until she finds a family. Right now, she's changed her mind on that and if Melanie does not improve she wants her out asap. AD also informed HM to let Melanie know, that if she is asked to leave, and if she cannot stay with friends, that she'll end up staying with AD, who imposes a 9 pm curfew, who won't drive her where she needs to go, and who won't loan her a car or bring her to the gym or place of her choice, so it behooves Melanie to behave better. AD reminded HM that she will be out of town, on vacation March 13-19 and will have an AD from SAV covering for emergencies/urgent matters, and Sarah states that she's confident that they will work it out and that help in my absence won't be necessary, but she'd like other AD's number just in case."
3607490,Host parents discussed the match and feel they would rather move forward even though they have had some minor bumps.
3607483,HM asked if AP can leave earlier than her current date and AD explained that once the ticket is booked we cannot change. HM said the AP will reach out to AD as well and did not give any details.
3607453,HM stated everything is going really well.  AP extended for 12 months.  AP was considering changing status to student visa but the timing didn't work out.  HM stated AP needs to get NJDL and look into classes for next year because the year will go by fast. AD will discuss with AP on next MC.
3607444,AP doing great. Boys are good. AP was home organizing while Babby at Grandmas. AP is recording the activities of the day in handbook. This is especially helpful when potty training.

3607411,Conducted apo. Too early to do the orientation but hm is expecting her third baby in a week. Hm has been very proactive with ap. She already took her to apply for a SSC. Ap has a detailed outline of her job description. Hf has not tested ap's driving yet
3607352,Everything is going well. HM asked for a DMV handbook. AD agreed to drop on off at their home.
3607348,Alex said that it was a bit of an adjustment getting Montse up to speed. She needed a lot of training with how to do things around the house related to the kids but she is up to speed. She is doing a great job with the kids.
3607317,"Moved to Tiburon - new address is... 1830 Mountain View Drive, Tiburon, 94920."
3607281,"very good, HM went back to work and AP is adjusting well with HC."
3607277,"very good, all adjusting well to each other."
3607276,"AD spoke with HM who says ap told her she wants to go home. AD spoke with HM again and she said that the ap is not engaging with the kids at all. When she spoke with her daughter, she said the ap is on her phone the whole time. AD met with ap, spoke about her decision to go home, and asked that she do a  more qualified and engaged job until she leaves. AP agreed."
3607213,Karla returned my call. She said things are good with Shiho.
3607212,Spoke with Rachel. She wanted to find out which doctor Diana could go because she had fever for few days. Her son had pneumonia. I advised her to call the number I gave during orientation.
3607211,Darby asked me about the deductible when an au pair gets into accident. Bettina got into an accident while working. Everybody is ok. I told her that $250 is all an au pair can pay towards deductible.

HD said that they won't be able to attend today's AP/HF St. Patrick's Day party because their youngest daughter Avery has an upper respiratory infection. HD said that he knows that current AP Jili is looking forward to finishing her program year in July. HD said that they have already started their new AP search in hopes of finding someone ""more mature this time around."" HD also commented that they revised their AP search criteria as well."
3607113,HM called to report APs car accident. AP backed swiped the side of their escalade into the garage damaging the car and the garage wall. HM is upset that AP does not have to pay for the entire repair. AD reminded HM that contractually the AP is only responsible for $250.00. AD sent HM and AP and email to reconfirm this. HM struggles with APs strong personality and feels that AP is not compliant with her wishes sometimes. AD suggested writing down her expectations that may now be different than prior to APs arrival.HM also said that gasoline is becoming an issue. AD suggested mapping out APs route and knowing what gas consumption is while children are in APs care. HM should explain the APs responsibility of filling the car up with gas for personal use. AD offered assistance with whatever HM needs help with discussing.
3607107,"Still not sure what to do about Selma- Sonia reports that one of the boys has been sick and that Selma appears to resent the Dr's appts and the extra care.  They are letting a friend from VA stay for 2 weeks as a favour to Selma and are hoping her attitude improves.  If not, AD will come to the house for coaching.  Planning to move back to DC this summer."

3606980,HF continues to be frustrated with AP and lack of participation with everyday & holiday family events.  HM would like to talk to the AP about being sent home early if communication does not improve.  AD has been talking with both AP and HM regularly.

3606943,HM reports that everything is dandy. They are constantly impressed by how mature their AP acts.
3606942,"HM said overall they are happy with AP, but that AP expects the kids to do too much work and that means less for the AP.  I said that kids those ages should be putting their own sheets on the beds and helping with meals and it was good AP was encouraging their independence, but yes, of course AP should be supervising.  I encouraged HM to get her AP a cell phone for safety reasons, esp with AP driving so much.  HM said she would speak to HD and they would think about it.  I encouraged HM to temper any criticism she had with AP with positives as well, because AP is worried they are unhappy with her."
3606937,"HM reports that AP is a hard worker and a rock star. However she met an AP from a different agency that told her she is not supposed to make meals for the kids or clean up their toys and room. AD assured HM that these were within program guidelines and AD will let AP know as well. AD and HM agreed that it is very important that AP attends the monthly events, like the one next weekend."

3606369,"AD spoke with HD.  He said things are going fine.  He said AP has got the schedule, and what to do, but that her personality hasn't really fit with their family.  He said the kids are not really bonded to her.  At the same time, he said it is not bad enough to ask for a rematch.  He said he has already discussed it with AP, but asked AD to remind AP that she can and will work most Saturdays when there are hours remaining, and also to not plan activities during week day work hours."
3606363,AD contacted HM.  She was in the middle of a trial and could only talk for a second.  She said she would call me if she needed anything.  She did say that they are thinking aobut a 6 month extension and have not looked at the info I sent them yet.

Hm was concerned that she was not meeting other Ap's. Ad reminded Hm about monthly meetings that Ap has not attended and encouraged her to have Ap attend.
3606010,"Everything is going good and fine, hf maybe able to let ap go home a little early haven't talked to her about it and hm has a new client that may change her schedule.

3605944,Good.
3605942,"HM Julie said that everything was running smoothly with AP Amanda until AP announced that she would be leaving the program early in order to go to CA for some job. Apparently, she plans to return home to Sweden first to renew her Visa. HM said that she felt that that AP Amanda made her decision with some sort of sense of entitlement and was selfish in not taking into consideration the family's perspective. HM said that this is the second AP to leave early so she is contemplating on whether or not to get another AP in fear that they will leave early,too. HM asked about her credit when AP Amanda leaves early."
3605925,Great.
3605917,Good
3605794,Very well. HF and AP will both be away on vacation. AD checked with HF about APs RF and if they need an AP for the summer. They will look for August arrival since the girls have summer programs.
3605779,"HM says things are going okay.  She called frustrated about AP wanting to change vacation dates just right before designated week.  HM and AP have worked out the details, but HM just wanted to vent and ask my assistance in helping set up vacation for new incoming AP.  HF wants to agree and lock in on dates early in the program year with next AP."
3605749,"I talked with Robyn this morning.  She requested to match with Miriam Schmidt.  The effective date should be 10 March vice the 14th.  HD will pick Miriam up at 10 a.m. on Monday.  I've alerted the current HM to that fact.  Last day with current HF is 9 March.  Miriam is currently out of town for a long weekend.  She gets back 9:45 p.m. Sunday.  The Rafferty's will pick her up and will make sure she gets a chance to say goodbye to the girls Monday morning before her new HF picks her up.

I've set up Miriam's orientation for Friday, March 10th at 1 p.m."
3605700,HF knows that APs year is coming to an end which is sad since she has been such a great addition to the family. AD gave repeat HF discount and early bird discount info. First AP Ana Carolina may have someone in mind who wants to come to Larchmont.

3605635,"Great, HM is happy with AP things continue to go well. No concerns or questions"
3605626,HM says that the situation with AP has not improved.  She says that AP is stuck on the customs in his country and won't accept our way. She says that he will not follow her clearly written out schedule for the kids.  She says that he has been serving the kids dinner at 8pm even though they need to be fed between 5-6pm. She says that the kids do not like his cooking and has specifically written out and highlighted recipes for him to follow but he alters the recipe to make it his way and the kids won't eat. She says that she asked him to look into taking the kids to the movies but she says when she asked he said he hadn't looked into yet. She says that he lacks motivation and is not sure what to do or say at this point. She says that she has a babysitter who has offered to help train AP during the day. HM says that she is frustrated and tired and feels bad that the kids don't like or respect AP because of the difficulties since he arrived. HM says that she will see if the babysitter helps but if not she will be looking to re-match even thought she doesn't have the energy or the time to do so.
3605623,"HD reports all is well, AP is ""excellent"" with HC and everyone loves her. AP is going to the gym and has made friends in the area. HF will travel the end of March and AP will have the week off."
3605621,HF has matched with extension AP and the AP verbally agreed yesterday. HF feels very happy with this decision and feels a connection with new AP.Current AP spoke to new AP as well and HM spoke to AD who was very helpful with info. Ingrid has been wonderful and can most likely train the new AP for some days.
3605607,"HM shared that the AP seems to be coming along since her grandfathers death and seems a bit more herself.  Shared how she recently had a big party for her close friend over the weekend and they all had a good time.  Feels that the weather has taken a toll on her and the children (having to be in doors most of the time) but, hopes that as it warms up things cheer up in the home as well.  HM shared she is happy overall with the AP. No concerns to spk of."
3605594,HF and AP are doing well and HF is very happy with APs work. AP had an opportunity to work for another family on Saturdays but AD addressed this concern and told HF that AP is not allowed to work outside the HFs home.
3605592,AP and HF had a sit down after AP returned from vacation and they discussed the AP not being honest about her IDL. They decided to move forward and finish the year together.
3605564,HM stated everything is gong well.  AP is settling in and the HC like AP.  HM stated they got her social security card and still need to get her a bank account and NJDL but they are planning to do that soon.  HM stated things are moving along nicely and there are no problems or issues.
3605539,"HM is still very frustrated with AP.  This week she clogged the garbage disposal so bad that they had to disconnect everything (even after she had done it once before), and then she was also driving around town with the baby in the car seat and the seat was not hooked in.  This is the 3rd time she has been told that she needs to check it every time she drives the kids and her reply was, ""I know.""  HM has not been happy from the start but also does not want to give up and possibly be left without childcare for a period of time.  HM is going to think about it more and get back with AD."
3605532,AD spoke with HM on 3/5. All is going well with Sara. She is enjoying her TOEFL course and meeting new friends there. HF is back in selections and will work with ME to make the early bird matching deadlines. AP is going to spend a weekend later this month in DC.

3605489,HM called and asked me if I could tell her how much she paid with APC last year.  I explained to her that she could call APC and they cold tell her.  HM says everything is going great.
3605347,"Everything is great with Lisa, however hf is sure that she isn't going to extend, so we talked at length about reappllying for the next au pair.  HF had good questions, want Spanish speakers this time around. HM will talk with hd and probably go online early next month to get started."
3605250,"Cassie in on vacation in Florida for 2 weeks with her mom and everyone at home here is sick, so hm is really missing her.

3605218,Great as usual. Marta had a great time in Hawaii and returned refreshed and ready to work. Will ask ap if coming to next meeting as close one.
3605205,Anna continues to do a great job with the kids.  She is taking her classes so she will be done in time for her departure in August.  They have agreed to let Anna leave the beginning of August.  We discussed arrival dates and when Kori would need to match by.  Looking at the latest July arrival.  She also asked if I could get her a statement of childcare costs for her taxes.

3605129,THings are off to a good start.  AP is doing fine.
3605119,"Everything is going well, they are going to San Francisco for spring break and Silvi's going with them.  HM keeps getting emails about renewing, asked if they'd be ok with the 3 month gap.  Advised no problem, she may want to go ahead and reapply and we'll change the target date to Nov 17th arrival.  Told her that would stop the emails."
3605090,"Everything is good, Juli is doing well.  There is one Columbian they are trying to interview and she'll let me know.  Juli's older sister is coming to visit in April and so hm and ap have been discussing that."

3605068,"Everything is going well, Anna got her driver's license in the mail!  That was the last hurdle.  Her permit doesn't expire until after she leaves, so they may leave it at that for now."
3605066,"AD contacted HD.  He said that everything was going great.  He mentioned the AP has a boyfriend.  He didn't seem thrilled, but wasn't upset.  They were out of town when I called."
3605065,"Very well- couldn't be better, family very pleased with Stacy."

3604946,Paul said everything is going very well with Liz so far.
3604943,"Everything is going good, they have asked Ile to extend with them and she has accepted.  They are all very excited.  HM worried about her paperwork not being returned and thought she had to send her passport in as well.  AD checked with AP who has her passport and advised hm via follow up email that I have requested a new DS form for her from APC and to please let me know when the govt returns her original."
3604939,Jillian said Carol is doing great with the kids. She can tell that Carol seems to have a little less energy and isn't making as much of an effort to make new friends. I told Jillian that this is normal for extension au pairs who have been here for a while.
3604936,"Very well, HF is thrilled with AP.  I asked about AP not getting hours through SMC and HM did not know about it.  She will help AP to verify this with the school and look into other options if necessary.  HF is thinking about a trip to Hungary in the future, AP will stay home and hopefully use her vacation time."
3604933,Everything is going well. She was in a meeting and said she would call back.  She loves the AP and said she had a funny story for me.

3604752,AP is staying with student visa. AD reminded HF that insurance will end March 20.
3604720,"Joy reports that things are going fine. In all honesty, she sounded very abrupt and hesistant and uncertain when she told me that things were fine. I gently prodded and asked her if there was anything she needed to address or discuss w/me, as the tone of her voice was a bit unsettling and sparked my curiosity, but she insisted that all was well and she had no problems to report. She may have been just busy at work, or in a meeting. I reminded her several times that I'm always here, should she need something, or need something addressed or mediated. She voiced understanding."
3604715,"Everything is good, they will have au pair pay $250 deductible for the car accident.  HM has told her again and again, no worries it happens, but ap is still feeling bad about it.

I said I would look into it.  She has decided that she will start looking for new AP's soon, and is looking for an August 7th arrival date."
3604673,"Rafaella is doing a good job, she has a boyfriend but isn't losing her focus.  HF probably done when AP is done, doubt if they're going to get another ap, advised if they do, they should be in the system in June at the latest."
3604669,good ap is doing well with the children host mom said that she is a different personality to Kerstin and has not really connected with the other girls HM is concerned that she might get homesick if she doesn't make connections. I will encourage the girls to reach out to her.
3604648,"Everything is good, however, hm has a cold and the baby was up all night.  Sawyer and Juliette are riding on the light rail as Sawyer has been asking about it.  Things are just great, Juliette is just the best.  Her boyfriend made them such a wonderful French meal before he went home it was one of the highlights of their week!"
3604642,"Spoke with Barrie. She said that things are great with Andrie. She said that she is going to try and make a go of things without an au pair and then if it doesn't work, go back into selection.

3604514,Overall it is going well. HF and AP sat down after AP was texting near the pool when HM had told her not to taker her eyes of the kids. They were upset when it happened but AP apologized and seems to understand now the importance and has been great ever since.  AP goes to city in time off and has friends and performs.
3604505,"Everything is going good, she did pass her driver's exam, ap's sister is coming in April and she's going to send her passport back with her.  Have talked a little bit about extending but hm wants to wait until the weather warms up and then they'll get serious about the discussion."

3604482,"Overall things are good, but AP has been asking for additional flexibility regarding her education courses and HM is not able to accommodate all requests. Specifically, AP would like to change her work hours which is something HM is unable to do. AP currently has a 6 hour window of free time each day when she is not working and also has flexibility on Tues/Fri. AD let HM know she was working with AP to find a course that might work for AP. HM noted that AP has $31 left towards her total education stipend."

3604360,AD spoke with HD who stated everything is going very well.  No complaints or concerns at this time.  HD mentioned they were very fond of Nikki and they miss her.
3604353,HM stated they are happy they matched with their new AP but not their current AP who decided she wanted to extend with a different family is moping.  HM stated she is probably just coping with her decision and may have had unrealistic expectations because she has an AP friend in CA and thought she could match with that family but that family wasn't interested.  HM stated that a lot of AP's friends have either gone home or rematched to another area.
3604341,"Everything is going great with Jessie, hf got moved to the new house and are now unpacking and getting settled.  Jess got her driver's license which is great and is figuring out school now. Advised hm I'll stop by next time I'm down that way."

3604291,"Spoke with Tamar. She said that things are not great with Stine. She was scheduled to work at 11 yesterday. Her alarm began going off at 10am. It was loud enough that it could be heard throughout the house. (Stine's room is in the basement.) Tamar went to see if she was all right and found Stine asleep on her phone with the alarm blaring. Tamar said that she had a very hard time waking her up. She expressed her concern to Stine, but she said everything was fine. Tamar said that she put Liya in preschool 5 days a week b/c Stine was struggling caring for the children and she moved her start time to 11am b/c she was having trouble being ready for work. Tamar said she doesn't take pride in her work and doesn't complete tasks. She has talked with her and Stine says she will do a better job, but things don't improve. Tamar said that she doesn't think she will break the match b/c it will be too difficult and she doesn't want to feel rushed looking for another ap. She is planning to reapply today and wants to take advantage of the early bird special."
3604275,HM says that they are great and are very excited to have matched one more time.
3604269,HM stated everything is great! HF and AP are fine.  They are happy and settled and don't need anything from AD right now.
3604268,HF is very happy with AP and she seems a good fit. HD asked AD to follow up with AP because they hope she is happy as well.
3604266,"HM Kristin said that everything is going well with AP Rubi. Rubi plans to marry her finance, so HF knows that she won't be available for extending. HM said that they would like to take Rubi home to Mexico over Spring Break, so I reiterated the travel requirements for first year APs leaving the US."
3604258,HM stated everything is going well.  AD mentioned that AP stated her biggest concern is taxes she owes.  HM stated that AP is great with HC but HM feels bad because he acts different when HP are around but said AP understands that happens often with families.
3604252,HF is very happy with AP. She is good with the kids and easy to get along with. HF needed SS # for old AP and AD helped.
3604191,host mom called things are going well with ap and they seem to  be getting over the rough patch. HF have family coming back to visit which seems to effect the communication but they plan to work together to complete the year.
3604184,HF have been contacted by matching team and will be looking for Andreas replacement. All is going well with no concerns.
3604170,"AD spoke to HM.  She said AP is doing fine.  She did talk with AP about not staying out so late so many consecutive nights, and she has been better about that.  HM shared that they did let AP floater Nina stay at their home, but said they want to encourage her to go home to Germany since she did not rematch, so they will not house her again if she asks. (AP Nina departed for Canada, but has said she may return to the U.S. before going home to Germany)."
3604160,"Everything is fine. AP is great, gets along well with family but is having trouble getting along with middle child. HM says AP is not proactive enough with the middle child, her second son. AD suggests regular check-ins with AP to discuss concerns/progress."
3604159,Things are fine as usual.
3604146,Heather said Agnes is doing great. She is currently on a road trip with Ewa and seeing several states. She is taking some vacation days and Heather is happy for her to have this great opportunity. Heather is writing a blog on well being and being positive - has several thousand followers. It has really changed her life.
3604132,Arias said they are meeting with AP this month to discuss some areas for improvements. She is lax on some of the basic duties and its frustrating to have to write everything down or tell her. Sometimes they feel she is here for her own personal fun rather than be AP.  She is good with their sons though and thats most important.
3604126,HF said they are looking forward to Nicole leaving on Friday. She has not been a good AP and he is a little disenchanted with the APs. Told me about his AP that moonlighted as a stripper! Not interested in AP through program at this time. Apologized for his not so upbeat monthly contact.
3604123,They are moving to nice larger home in Lafayette later in the month. Will go online and renew application once new house closes. Fanny is doing well. They are celebrating Fat Tuesday a day later.
3604122,Jaeme said they still need to make the time for AP to get SS#  and CDL although she has been driving. They think she is the greatest and don't ever want her to leave. Enjoying new home in Orinda.
3604118,HF said everything is going great. AP is wonderful and they could not be happier.
3604117,Stacey returned call from 3/5. She said everything is good  and no concerns.
3604116,hM said they are all ready and excited for new AP arrival tomorrow night but they are all going to be sad to see Bruna go. Scheduled O/A for 3/20 after Bruna leaves. They will both be at Pizza Night.
3604111,Things are going well. They are off to a good start. She had some questions on insurance and schools
3604109,HM provided me with new contact phone because they never use home phone. All is great with AP. They are going to extend with her and getting education and things in order to submit paperwork.
3604108,Very good - they love her and they are hoping that she will end up extending.
3604107,Very good - they love her and they are hoping that she will end up extending.
3604105,They are very happy with Anita and everybody seems to be adjusting well.  No issues or concerns at all.
3604103,All is great. They love their AP. They are going to extend for 6 mos. Told her its a bit early to submit paperwork and education must also be completed. They need only 3 more hours to fulfill. Otherwise everyone is happy and doing well.
3604099,AD spoke with HM Sue. Isabelle is doing much better and is in good spirits since booking her return flight. AP is hopeful to gain employment with her college friend and AP Rosita upon her return. Ap studies very hard all the time for her TOEFL test she will be taking soon. Isabelle is so good with Travis it will be hard to see her leave the family.
3604098,Called to check in and let HM know I am interim AD and wanted to make sure she has contact info. She said they are all fine and no questions or problems.
3604069,"AD spoke with HD Todd.  Things overall are going well.  HF has no issues with the AP in terms of his AP responsibilities and is happy that AP volunteers to so extra things around the house to show initiative and care for the family.  One thing that the HD mentioned for the area of improvement is in his speech.  He's picked up some impolite phrases and tones (probably from school) such as ""what?"" Instead of ""pardon?"" and ""OMG"" which the HC started to say also.  HD pointed this out to the AP to be mindful of his choice of language in front of Robert.  HF and AP will be taking a cruise for Spring Break.  AD confirmed that the AP will be having his private space that's separated by a partition."
3604019,"Per HD they just love Mary and would love to keep her forever.  She is doing a fantastic job.  They do want to extend but AP has a job commitment back home that she would need to be back for in January, which is 5 months from the end of her year.  AD explained to HD that they could extend for the 6 months, and if it turns out that Mary does need to leave a month early they could fill out the early departure agreement, or they could split the match and AP would pay for her rtn flight home.  HD said they would probably go with signing the early departure waiver as they lover her so much."
3604002,"Well.  They are excited that Angie is going to extend with them.  They have logged in and are updating their application.  I've reminded the family about what Angie needs to do and sent them the ""extension FAQs"".  I gave them the deadline too.  Richard is easier to get in touch with now that he's home during the day.  We talked about Angie's plans to go back to Colombia for vacation next month.  I told him she should have her new DS by then."
3603998,"s/w HM - states things are going good - there were some minor issues and they've had talk w/AP about but would like to mention it to met - they were all supposed to go to baseball game Fri night and AP was coming to meet the HM and HD with the kids - she said the AP did not allow herself enough time to get downtown from Cypress, she left w/o any gas in car so they had to stop and get gas and traffic from Cypress to Downtown on a Fri eve is very bad - family had to end up canceling plans and that frustrated the HM - she said the AP has been using car a lot more frequently than what they originally agreed upon and they would like for them to tell her where she will be versus just an area of town - adv that is understandable due to it being their veh - they also think that the AP needs to make her vacation plans b/c family already planned their time off so that the AP could take their time, but AP seems to be getting frustrated b/c cannot find anyone to go on vacation with her - adv will mention this to her as well and possibly give some ideas to her or encourage her to reach out to other AP's for their plans - she does get along well w/kids and is good with them - HC Danny will be starting baseball soon so they will do practice runs with AP to the ball field to make sure she knows where it is, what time she needs to be there and allow herself enough time"
3603988,"lm for HM earlier today and she called me back - s/w HM - everything going good, no issues.  HF getting ready to go to Seattle for Spring Break, but AP is staying behind and going with friends to Dallas and to the rodeo - they have completed their extension and are happy about same - adv to let me know if anything needed"
3603976,"AD and HM spoke on the phone.  The HM is concerned because she received a statement with three toll violations from the AP.  The HM was frustrated because two of the violations were early in the morning over the weekend.  the AP told the HM that she takes the car for the weekends to a friends house but does not drive it to bars.  One of the toll charges was at a toll plaza that is over 1-2 hours from the HF's home.  IT appears as if the AP is not telling the truth and trust is broken.  The HM reported that the extra charges are $37.00.  The HM and HD will talk to the AP and may need to enforce some strict guidelines on car usage.  The HF has been very generous with the AP, so it is surprising that the AP has done this."
3603968,"They are doing fabulous! Hd was traveling all last week but Grandma came and helped with the kids and they all had a good time. HF is really hoping AP will extend longer than 6 months, but they are waiting for her to make a decision."
3603961,Ok. Though HF had a big talk with her last night about their concern that she seems to refuse to take an an English class. Has signed up for Art but HF say her English really needs improvement and yet she seems really reluctant to sign up for an English class. Ap acknowledged conversation but the proof will be in whether she signs up for an English class or not. I had spoken to ap about this last month too and said she should do an English class. i will check in with her again.
3603910,Good
3603888,"AD talk to HM she said everything is good. Gust is very nice person and do her job well however HM feels like she doesn't want to be part of the family like her previous Au Pair's . They always ask her if she wants to watch movie with them it would help her to improve her English. HM feels like Gust English is same like she arrived , she just hang out with her Thai friends . HM is pushing her to start looking for classes or take weekend course. Sometimes they don't know if Gust understands . HM shared with me they all are going to Bahamas in June , they are working on Gust visa to Bahamas."
3603852,Well.  Estefania seems to be doing very well.  She has made friends and seems to have a good social life.  Her homesickness seems to be a lot better and she is doing a good job with the baby.  They are getting better and better at the baby's schedule and working together.  Amylynn recently went back to work part-time and is gearing up to work longer and longer hours as she gets more comfortable.
3603851,"AD spoke to HM she said Caity is absolutely wonderful, probably the best AP they ever had and they love her. The whole family is flying to Key West for Spring Break ."
3603848,"Spoke with Claudia.  She asked about the Monthly AP meetings, if they were mandatory for the AP's  Tera doesn't want to attend them but will show up to sign in if needed.  HF and AP still have big personality differences but are making it work.  HM doesn't think they will extend with Tera because for the first time with an AP it feels weird to have a stranger in the home."
3603806,"HM states everything is going well. HM was asking me about Ola tax form I emailed her form , sample form and Au Pair cheat sheet. HF is flying to FL next week. Ola is flying to NYC with her friends. Last week they all went to Sky to New York ."
3603774,HFM reports everything is going fine.  I confirmed that it was the Bahamas that she was interested in knowing about and told her I would email her the form with questions about extension travel.  Zoe should be ok to travel to the Bahamas though.
3603764,"Mike reports that things are going very well. He says that this month will be a whirwind month, as they are moving into a 5 bedroom rental home, in Durbin Crossing, near the home he's having built, on March 15, and the kids have spring break the week of March 17. He said that Elisa will have her very own private room, in a private loft! He says her English and driving are both improving greatly, and she's developed a nice network of Brazilian friends and is very social."
3603756,Max is doing a great job. Emmett really likes him. They are going to miss him
3603745,"Everything is great, HM thought she wouldn't be the last one this month!!!  Camilla will be going home in June and reapplying for a student visa from there.  Hopefully she'll be able to come back in time for August school start.  The counselor at the college advised her this was the best way to do it."
3603743,HM said that match is going great.  She said the AP is awesome and things are going well will her daughter at the new school.  HM is very concerned about one of her AP's friends in NY. AD assured her that the RM in NY is handling it appropriately.
3603732,"Everything is going good!  Toon got her dl and now they need to review the car rules with her.  She was gone with the car all day on sunday and HM didn't know she was taking the car.  Also AP had asked for the $500 for school is that the norm?  Advised hm better to write the check to the school and in many cases we can get school done for less than #500, hm will talk to her about that and tell her that $500 will go towards her stipend for the next few weeks and they'll write out a check for school."
3603697,"AD contacted HM.  She is still frustrated that the AP has not gotten her license.  AD is going to contact AP about this.  HM said that if she doesn't have it by the event, it is going to be an issue."
3603695,"HM needs a very strong team player who can take charge and make sure things get done and that AP follows up and makes sure the HC for example do their homework, put laundry away and AP is not doing a good job with this. HM has been very patient and talks to AP often but at this time after almost 3 months she really needs someone who is the extra set of hands and able to do all necessary. HM is considering ending the match."
3603648,HM says all is well and doesn't need to discuss anything much now. All is going well with Anni!
3603626,"HM reports things are going good, no problems to report. She is still adjusting to the schedule and adjusting to the new home."
3603624,"HM thinks things are going really well. AP asked to go on a vacation so HF allowed her to take the time early and travel since they were able to find help with the kids. AP had a birthday a few weeks ago and HF hosted a party with several AP. HM commented on how wonderful all the AP were and what a mature, sweet, kind group of AP we have right now. AD told HM she was glad things were going well and that HM reports things seem to be off to a good start with HD and AP as well. They are noticing a lot of little extra things AP does that is helpful. HM also said that AP has her SSN and a bank account now."
3603619,"Things are going well and Nidia is such a sweet nice girl.  HM does have one concern, because Niyam has such bad exema and AP has to apply a lot of different creams on him, her finger nails have become an issue.  Niyam told HM that she scratches him and HM is also concerned that when she is putting cream around his eyes that bactiria could also be an issue.  HM said she is going to have AP start to use gloves to put the cream on and that may help.  She then suggest to AP that she needs to either trip her nails or when she is putting the cream on in the eye area or other delicate areas that she use a knuckle rathe than the tips of her fingers.  Hopefully this will solve the issue.  Niyam has also been going through a bad hitting and pinching stage that HP and AP are working on together.  He pintches not just the AP but the parents as well."
3603582,"HM says that things are going really well with AP and the kids already love her. She thinks AP is happy too and HM says she is just thrilled and ""happy as a clam"" with the way things are going."
3603572,Things are going really well and HM says AP has been very helpful. AD let HM know that AP had given AD her coursework papers so they can request the extension whenever they are ready. HM thanked AD for the information.
3603563,Spoke at length with Erle. He said that things are not going well with LIna. She has improved somewhat with her responsibilities but he is frustrated with their interaction. Often she will ask something and she will continue to pursue the issue with Erle if he does not give her the answer she wants. He said that she wanted to hook an internet cable to her TV (She has cable. It was a way for her to get extra movies.) He told her no and she continued to pursue the issue with him asking why it was a problem and that she didnt'tsee anything wrong with it He admitted being short with her. He shared that he is under a great deal of stress as his sister from Ohio is in Philadelphia seeking treatment for ovarian cancer and has been very ill. Lina has wanted to sign up for classes and Erle asked her to wait until the end of winter. This has been an ongoing issue as Lina wants to take classes now. Erle is away for a couple of days. He has some friends who will be staying with the kids. Suggested we talk when her returns from his trip.
3603561,"AD talked to HM for 1/2 hour.  She said the AP was sick for a couple days but still tried to work even though the HF didn't want her to.  Sounds like AP feels guilty and is just trying to help. AP has not eaten very much and the HM concerned.  Also the baby is not taking a bottle from the AP and the HM seems stressed out.  HM also states the AP gets car sick and doesn't do well on buses.  Also is picky about food.  HM said she would have liked to have know this before she picked.  AD recommended that HF sit down with AP and discuss issues.  Told her also to write them down as she goes over them.  HM said AP is very sweet, but has concerns.  AD offered a mediation if it didn't work."
3603559,Spoke with Jeanette. She said things are great with Ana. They are trying to help her with the medical bills. Advised that I asked Ana to send me copies.
3603536,It is going well. HM has started interviewing APs. She has a few that she likes and is trying to decide if she should move forward with a woman who doesn't have much driving experience.
3603535,Everything is going well. AP has a new cell number and HD gave AD that number. HD had a question regarding AP filing taxes and AD is going to look into the answer and get back to him.
3603522,Good
3603521,"HM and AP had discussion about duties and expectations.  HM thought it went well, but will let AD know if she needs AD to speak with AP."
3603517,Fine
3603486,Good
3603483,Things are going really well with Lorena. HM says she has been a huge help lately while HM preps for her art show and has been willing to step up and help out a lot. HM is very appreciative of that and wishes AP could extend (although she understands why she needs to go home at the end of her program year).
3603482,Great.
3603453,"Everything is great, can't believe they are 2 months away from Michaela leaving.  Wanted to be sure her flight stuff got worked out, assured hm it did.  Previous ap visiting right now which is fun and another coming in a few weeks, they are enjoying that.  Ok to leave hm on my referral listing even when they're done."
3603434,AP is wonderful.  AP spend one week in Orlando with family.  Ap's brother is coming in April and HF will surprise AP with his visit
3603428,HM stated everything is really good and AP's health has improved greatly.  AP saw a doctor and seems to be well now.  No complaints or concerns at this time.
3603407,"Everything is going great, Lisseth is her little buddy, Tony has been traveling a lot and hm and her have bonded well.  It will be interesting to see how it goes when he starts being home more.  She's started school and that's helped and she and Toon have become good friends which is good."
3603322,"HM thinks things are going great, Jess is really responsive to discussing things and she's doing great with the kids.  She got her social got her driver's license, needs help with school which I told hm I helped her with on Monday, so we'll see where that goes."
3603178,Good AP is a loner but good with kids and serious about life and work
3603177,"HM stated everything is going well.  Just went back to work and baby starts daycare on Monday which will give the family and AP more consistent work hours, but it has been stressful.  The baby was sick and AP wanted to help but there wasn't much she could do.  HM stated she would like to extend with AP but is waiting to hear if AP is interested. AP wanted to extend for 6 months but HM stated they would only extend for 12 months because of timing.  HM also stated if AP doesn't extend she would be interested in matching with another AP already in the area. AD stated I would keep that in mind.  HM stated there was an issue where AP was driving other APs everywhere and no one was sharing responsibility.  HM stated AP was also driving outside of permitted area.  HM and AP discussed issue and HM noticed AP friends were starting to pick her up sometimes.  HM also stated they will be getting rid of extra car and so they have to readjust expectations as far as weekend use of car."
3603174,"HM spoke very  highly about Luiza. She said she's very loving, nice. HM is taking her out for dinner tomorrow evening  for her birthday. HM is very happy to have her , she's great with the children."
3603168,good ap has decded that she would like to see another part of the US so will not be extending with her current host family. The family have applied and will look for a replacement.
3603143,HM stated everything is great.  No complaints or concerns at this time.  Everything is running very smoothly.
3603142,AD spoke to HD he said everything is going well. Adel told him this  morning she wants to extend  for 6  months. She would like to stay longer but her dad in Czech is turning 50 and she wants to be home for his birthday.
3603126,"It is going OK, but HM still feels there is a stranger living in her house taking care of the children. The connection they felt with previous APs is just not there. AP spends a lot of time at home and HM asked AD to encourage him to go out more and do things. AD sent list of other male APs in area and will follow up."
3603125,"Lyda is very sweet, and does many good things, but HM wishes AP would step up her game, and pay more attention to details.  Today she took girls to school without their coats and it's 34 degrees outside, girls have outdoor play every day.  Also she frequently looses the house and car keys.  The other day, HD found the keys on the floor of his car….someone could have seen them, broken in to steal the car.  HM is disappointed that AP doesn't talk to the girls more in Spanish, teach them Spanish songs, games, and stories as HM as asked.  Also HM schedules laundry to be done while girls are at school, but twice she has come home to find AP folding laundry and girls playing by themselves.  HM wants AP engaging with girls, and doing laundry while they are in school.  AD will talk to AP 3/9/14."
3603104,"Everything is great - AP will extend, will have school finished in time - HM worries about what the AP will do for money because she spends everything she has - she will talk to her about withholding some of her stipend as a savings account -"
3603082,"HF had requested a mediation meeting for 3/5 but they had a positive meeting with the AP two days ago and went over cell phone use during work and her being more engaged with the children, esp the baby. They will keep AD posted of how things are going the next couple of weeks. AD spoke at length to HM the end of last week and again on 3/4. HF has given AP a diary to write down daily things she does with the baby/kids, and given her more structure with info and times on reading, dancing, playing etc."
3603039,"HF and AP talked and AP decided she will be returning home after her first year. With that in mind, they decided to release Ap early as they will be traveling to Japan in June. I discuss early release steps with HF and requested Return flight request email for AP. HF said they met this Ap that is looking for a family for her extension year. HF shared that girl is with a different agency and they will most likely switch the agency. HM shared she loves working with me and APC but this girl is really great and they have so much in common. Also, they met her in person several times as she is Miku's friend."
3603034,Julie is just few days away from completing her extension year. HF said they had a great experience and that they will continue to speak well of APC and our program. HM said it is kind of sad to see Julie leave and to see kids grow and becoming independent. HM thanked me for all my assistance and help.
3603033,Spoke to HM about Kris's rematch process. hM shared Kris has a hard time as she believes all families that called are not a good match for her. HM said she hopes Kris will find a nice family soon. kris will have a goodbye party in the park that kids and her are organizing.
3603032,HF is ready to start their au pair search. I informed HF of changes in our matching department and offered my help with applicants they chose to interview. Pavlina is still not sure what her near future holds. HM said she is so wonderful and they hope things will work out for her
3603022,"Everything is just great, hm just sitting with everyone watching movies before bed.  Lucasz is great as always and she is glad he is extending.  Advised her of the savings financially for extending and she is thrilled.  Told her we'd walk through the app as we got a bit closer"
3603011,"Very well, they want to extend with AP for another year.  HD is concerned about her getting enough credits, AP did the weekend program and only needs 8 more hours.  I asked him to have AP look at auditing courses that she liked.  HD had questions about taxes, I assured him AP would not be required to file, as she arrived after August 5, 2013."
3602989,HF reports everything is fine. They decided to go ahead and start looking for another AP now instead of waiting until June. They are going to login and reapply tonight. They are looking for a April 15 arrival and someone from Turkey.
3602976,"Things are fine withJeanine, calls emailand meeting."
3602973,"They continue to plug along and are doing fine.  Brandon and Emily are both ""in stages"" right now, giving lots of attitude and moods, but they are all dealing with it and just hoping that they out grow it quickly."
3602965,"Things are okay, we are finishing up fine.  Calls, meeting and email."
3602960,"Everything is going okay.  We are requiring AP to speak only English, and she is doing much better."
3602952,"Things are okay, HM will be speaking to AP about an incident with child behavior and APpunishment that HM witnessed and didd not approve of.  HM's will speak with AP and get back to AD."
3602846,"Spoke with Pia.  Her only complaint is that AP is too shy.  She is great with the kids and responsible.  She just doesn't talk much, answers questions  politely, but does not initiate conversation.  AP sits in her room and reads books in free time.  I told HM I would encourage AP to sign up for classes soon and get together with other AP's in the area."
3602794,"Good. Still in transition though. Susan feels she needs to repeat and reinforce things with Iwona. She is using lots of positive encouragement. Susan  said she  is taking more responsibility for the older 2 children to lighten the load for Iwona. Ideally though she would like Iwona to be able to handle all 3 children at one time. Susan understands they are still in the transition phase. She also admits/agrees the older children are testing Iwona. The family is going through a divorce and living in an apartment. She is hoping that after the upcoming mediation she, Iwona and the children will be able to move back into the family home.   I asked Susan if she has a written schedule and written instructions. She said she does, but that she has to keep going over things with Iwona.   I offered to speak with Iwona. At this point, Susan would like to continue to work on it herself."
3602737,HF is looking forward to the arrival of Nathalia. Happy she has arrived safe and sound at the orientation. Vicky is around for a few more days but will be staying with her boyfriend for the month
3602726,Line is doing really well. She is around a little more than their last au pair. She is super nice and very active seem like she will be active
3602722,"HM stated AP is great with HC but a terrible roommate.  AD discussed the possibility of having a mediation to deal with some of the issues but HM said she has talked to her about all of these issues numerous times and nothing changes.  HM stated she is willing to tolerate these issues (untidy; lateness) because she is good with HC, speaks good English, is a good driver, is loving, fun and bright.  There have been no more smoking incidents and they had a great vacation together.  HM is willing to tolerate though because AP is so great with HC."

3602693,"Sofia is doing great. Her driving has improved. She is developing a relationship with the children and especially good with the twins. She is a little reserved, but kind and sweet"
3602674,"Things are going well with Bruna. The relationship with the children is still challenging, But HM stated that she is working hard on improving it. The household chores are being done and she has done an amazing job organizing the children's toys"
3602644,"HD called me to discuss Alvaro's health issues. He was not happy when I told him that the insurance might not cover the treatment because it was a pre-existing condition. He started yelling at me saying that we should screen AuPairs better and do not let them apply for the program with medical issues if we are not going to cover the treatment. He pointed out that Alvaro is alone here and he needs to get a treatment immediately and they do not want to lose their child care. HD said they paid a lot for the program and after a month they will stay without the childcare because of the insurance company. I told him that Alvaro needs to see a doctor and get his opinion and diagnoses. After we know what is going on and what it needs to be done we can have a clearer picture of what the insurance will cover. HD yelled at me that I should worry about Alvaro and find him a doctor near by. I explained that it would not be a problem for me to find a doctor, schedule an appointment and even take Alvaro to the office but I was not sure what kind of issues Alvaro was having. HD did not know either because he was on a business trip in NY. I asked Alvaro to write me an email in Spanish and try to explain what kind of issues he is experiencing and what happened three years ago when it happened for the first time. Alvaro wrote me an email in English saying :""The problem is basically for my stomach and my intestine, I am a constipated person. I mean, when I go to the bathroom to make my necesities I have problems doing it because I can't do it right. Everyone go to the bathroom every day but sometimes that is impossible for me, sometimes I only go to the bathroom 3 times per week and when that happens and I go to the bathroom after some days without do it, it hurts me a lot and, three years ago my anus got dilated and I suffered a tear in it. That means wounds inside the anus and that made me bleed. From that moment, each time that I went to the bathroom, I did bleed and it hurts me a lot. Each day was getting worse until I decided to go to the doctor and they hospitalized me because of the problem. They had to made me a rectoscopy and so many test and the found several wounds and I had to be cared a long time by a nurse, with a special diet and many revisions in the hospital. Now, its happening again since almost 4 weeks ago. I started bleeding a little bit, but in this moment, it's bleeding much more each time and much more than 3 years ago. I barely can go to the bathroom and when I go, it makes me cry because of the pain. The problem is that three years ago, the doctor told me that if this happens again, I would need a colonoscopy because I could have a problem in the colon or an infection on the intestine.       This is the whole thing, I hope it's clear for you."" I called the ""nurse line"" and got an information that Alvaro should see a proctologist but first he needs to go to a regular M.D. and they will refer him to a specialist. I sent Alvaro and his HPs a list of general doctors near by with the addresses and phone numbers but they asked me to make an appointment. I was trying to get him an appointment for today but the first available appointment  is on Thursday March 6. Alvaro does not want to wait that long and he said he would go to urgent care tonight because he is still bleeding and in pain. Alvaro also told me that he wants to go home but does not know how to tell that to his hosts."

3602574,"Everything is wonderful, Stephanie is just the best.  They have anew baby boy coming in July and are hoping the ap wants to extend with them, they can't imagine life without her.  Advised hm I recommend talking to the ap 6 mos out.  HM wants to wait for the weather to warm up as AP is a beach baby and she wants her to experience the warmer Colo weather to be more positive about staying.  We discussed the extension process at length."
3602474,"HM Lucia says that things are fine with AP Matilda.  They look forward to Shoko's arrival next week (APO scheduled for 11AM on 3/13, Wed.).  We talked about room arrangements.  Lucia is very organized and high energy and is going to be thoroughly prepared for her multiple APs."
3602437,Good
3602421,Pamela said that she has been super busy with both kids and Kyoko has been great. She is excited to welcome their next au pair in May and thinks that the fact that she is from Mexico will be a nice change for them. I gave her recommendations of how to simplify her life by signing up for 6 free months of google express and also look at signing up for Amazon Prime. She really appreciated my suggestions and said she will look at those options today.
3602415,Linda said that she is going to work with Mireia to see how she can help improve how she deals with Mateo. They may go together to a specialist who can coach them regarding his behavior since he is on the Autism spectrum. Mireia is really scared that she won't be able to handle managing all three kids during the summer when she has many more hours with them than the school year since Mateo is so challenging. Linda is aware of how Mireia feels and plans to do whatever she can to help Mireia.
3602405,Great.
3602391,Good
3602351,Jennifer said Julie is doing great with the kids. It has been a challenge for the kids to learn German from her and Jennifer has taken a step back with it and has given up a bit on getting the kids to become fluent in German. Maybe they would consider switching the kids into an emersion school but she is going to let her husband decide that.
3602270,HM stated AP is patient and so sweet
3602249,AD spoke to HM about the concerns the AP has mentioned to AD about discipline children and the HF and AP working as a team to reinforce certain things. HM was happy with the conversation and was not aware that the AP is so frustrated. HM will sit down with AP and we have a mediation meeting scheduled for Saturday at 10:30
3602246,"Stephanie said Ayumi is doing well with the boys. She wishes she could spend a little more time with her oldest son but he does his own thing and the younger two are more needy of her attention so she understands why that is. Also, Stephanie is taking her oldest son to Japan for 10 days 10th-19th with her mother as well. Her husband will be around and her nanny as well."
3602219,"Great, Hm states that AP is doing great with HC and they are really happy. AP spend a lot of weekend time away with a friend,"
3602211,"AP has VERY poor english. It is difficult for her to communicate. She is currently feeling vey overwhelmed. HF has been great at giving her time to adjust. HF is in the middle of a move, they have just closed on new home and move the end of the month. Kids are still adjusting to having a new person in the home."
3602206,"Things are not going so great.  HM called AD in confidence to see what it would entail to rematch. AP has been defiant and has been telling HM what she will and will not do, even though those things are withing guidelines.  For example, HM told AP they were keeping child at home because he had a sore throat and AP told HM, well then it's on you, those are not my hours.  Also, she added her own hours for laundry that she was doing and also added hours before picking up child.  HM is not upset that the AP required more hours, rather it is the way she handled it by telling the HM what to do rather than asking or discussing.  Also, AP is now always gone on weekends to boyfriend, although she promised HF that this would not be an issue. AP is also not keeping up with the little things that regard the child and his schoolwork. HF is going to discuss and either sit AP down or have AD come in and sit down with them to discuss."
3602173,Katie said that she and Joe decided last week that they are going to stay put and not move to the east bay as the market is so crazy and the housing prices keep going up.

3602171,"Everything is fine, but the HFM wants to know about getting a 2nd AP well before Carol's time is up, as she is not comfortable with bringing in a new AP in the middle of the summer.  She wants to go ahead and start looking now."
3602166,"AD spoke to HM , she said she's shopping with Anja and talking about Anja's return flight. HM enjoys Anja's company and will miss her when her program year comes to end. I asked HM if they planning to reapply to our program. She said they are not sure. HD got new job offer in New Jersey and they are going to move in August."
3602165,"Everything is going really well per hd, they are really happy with Ingrid and are happy she went to coffee night, she was nervous when he dropped her off, but came home all smiles.  He is on the way into a meeting, and has no questions now, but if he does, he'll callme back!"
3602160,AP still has some issues that come up but they deal with them on a weekly basis.  AP was asked by HC classmate's mother to babysit for their child as well.  HM asked AD how to tell the other mother that she didn't want that.  AD explained that the Host Family Agreement states AP responsibility does not include the care for another child's family and to say the agency does not allow it.
3602141,everything is going good. Danna have one more month with the family . HM said she's very pleasant to be around and great with the children. They will miss her they home they still will be in touch after her program ends. HF are not planning at this moment reapply to the program. HM decided to stay home with the children.

Chris said that he and Danielle will be discussing moving forward or considering alternate care. Hopefully by April they will have a decision made."
3601964,Spoke with Dana. They are going to extend with Charlotte! They had some questions about travel in her extension year and also travel at the end of her first program year. Charlotte's step-dad was diagnosed with stomach cancer. Charlotte would like to travel home mid-August to see him. Her visa expires 9/23/14. Advised that APC does not recommend travel outside the U.S. 1 month before her visa expires. Suggested applying for her extension and traveling to France with her new DS-2019. She will apply for a new visa while home in August.  Dana said that things are terrific. They talked through the issues they had last month and are very excited to extend.

HM said that she feels like she needs to walk on eggshells about every little things with AP as AP gets defensive of has a bit of a ""know it all"" attitude.

3601828,HM has concerns about AP's driving. She is good with kids but there are concerns about the safety of her driving. I called and left message. Also emailed to let her know I was trying to respond to email sent to Julia.
3601827,Things are going well. Robyne said she has sent her friend that is interested in the program my contact info and info about APC but she has not responded.
3601823,"HM very pleased with this new AP.  She has energy, initiative and just ""got it"".  The baby didn't sit in wet diapers, she made eggs for the kids for breakfast, asked her if there was anything else she could do for the HM before she got off the clock this afternoon."
3601820,"Spoke more with Heather and she said that Agnies probably hit the home sickness this past month She describes Agnies as a little blunt, incredibly honest and so sometimes she says she is all alone. However she came with them to Tahoe as the HF didn't want her to be alone and they think she really enjoyed that. She has now made friends with Busi so that is good, they live close to one another and Busi is really sweet."
3601819,"actually amazing.  Bell is speaking Mandarin so HM is thrilled.  Concerned that AP is SO happy all the time, wants to make sure she is really happy, rather than putting on a good face (like the other two did)"
3601808,Everything is excellent.  Kids like her and she is hard working.  They are doing well.

3601775,"s/w HM - said things are going well and AP relating well w/HC - she said they are spending more than they bargained for as AP purse got stolen out of mini van when dropping son off at school - she left the van unlocked and got her credit card, international driver's license and cell phone taken - they filed police report but nothing has been turned in - HF helped her get a new cell phone and she is applying for TX license now - also she is wanting her boyfriend and parents to come visit and she is wanting them to stay at the HF home - adv her they are not obligated to have family/boyfriend stay there but they need to discuss/set expectations with her up front - family's religious beliefs do not allow for sleeping over before marriage - adv agree not good for kids to see her having boyfriend sleep over - also AP asking HF to sign a letter for her parents to give to the consulate - adv never heard of this before but checked w/Maureen and not acceptable for AP to ask HF to do this - sent email to Scott to see if can we can provide participation letter for the AP's parents"
3601738,"HM said that everything has settled down and that AP Maria has calmed down about her dislike of the schedule. So HM said that it's a ""controlled chaos"" right now with newborn twins. HM said that AP has a toothache and that she called UnitedHealthCare to find out exactly what the AP dental policy is. UHC advised AP that she may go to any dentist so HM asked me for the name of my dentist,where I have referred other APs before."
3601673,Kat is great attitude and is doing well.  There is always a learning curve but it gets better each day.  HM also asked me to send the fees involved with extending.

3601576,"The AD spoke to the HM on the phone for 40 minutes this morning. The HM appeared to be upset as evidenced by the tone of her voice. The AP overslept this morning and was not able to wake up at 7am for his job duties. This is the second time that this has occurred in the last two months. The HP's are very upset by this because they depend on the AP to wake up the kids in the morning and get them ready for school. The HM stated that if this happens a third time, then the AP will go into rematch.   The HM is also concerned because the AP has been hanging out with friends who smoke, which has caused a terrible smoke smell in part of the home and the AP's car. The AP spends the weekend at the friends home and comes back and all of his clothes have a horrible smoke smell which has penetrated his room and is moving to part of the home. The HM has asked the AP to dry clean and wash his clothes several times to get rid of the smoke smell. The HM does not think the AP is smoking but has doubts."
3601502,Trina said everything is great with her family. She did mention that when Camilla's boyfriend was here visiting they were in her bedroom with the door shut and they had just gotten back from being away for a week so the kids were really excited to see her. when they knocked on her door that morning Camilla didn't respond probably because she didn't want to be with the kids yet. It was her boyfriend's last day there so Trina thinks they just wanted to some alone time. I advised Trina not to say anything to Camilla since her boyfriend lives in Brazil and probably won't be visiting again during her year. Trina agreed.
3601496,Nicole said that she is starting to look for their next au pair but it's too early. They will go online over the next month and if they need help they'll reach out.

HD told me that they might want to search for an au pair with special needs experience because of their son's hyperactivity.  They realize it isn't a necessity but would like to opportunity to see those profiles if possible.  Their son doesn't have an official diagnosis yet though.  HD also asked me why we don't have au pairs from the Dominican Republic.  I referred him to our SF office for more info on that.  He is going to reach out to Sarah Altman first concerning the special needs designation.

3600641,"Ad spoke to HM on Sunday march 2, she was worry if Angel flight was going to be cancel during bad weather we were expecting. Thankfully we didn't get that much snow and Angel was able to fly to his new family on March 2. HM said they had nice dinner on Saturday evening  had a lot of talk and laugh. HM is leaving our program and she hopes Angel finds his happiness in CA."
3600601,"HM stated that the family is well and she was surprised that Laura V was not upset to hear about Lara P's return home.  She seems to be taking it fine.  HM stated that Laura is trying so hard that she appreciates it, although she still is not Lara P and can not handle as much responsibility as her and can not be trusted to administer medications.  I explained to HM that the learning curve for this au pair may be greater and that I appreciate her patience and her understanding and coaching."
3600600,Michelle and the family are well.  She stated that Lara Petry is well and is returning home no later then April 5th.  I extended this information to the team so that her RFR can be booked.  She is very sad to see her go and is having trouble finding a replacement with the background and character that they need.  She is hiring an American babysitter for now.
3600599,"AD spoke to  HD , he said Natalia is wonderful person full of love . She does great taking care of their children , taking them to different activities or just get nails done. Girls love her . They're all going to BAhamas for Spring Break by end of the month."

I also told her I would send links for education information."
3600529,"AD spoke to HM , she said things are going well. They had a great year and almost half with Laura. Laura still have couple months left. HM already match with a new AP.

3600495,HM Beata continuously says that Saskia is such a blessing. She tends to all 3 children's needs. Last week was Nicholas' birthday and she made a very special card for him with the twins. Nicholas truly treasured it and felt important. AP also made special M&M chocolate chip cookies as a surprise! AP is finishing her education in the coming weeks. Only concern is that AP needs to be more conscious of energy conservation including the space heater which of often left on and could therefore be a fire hazard.
3600493,"AD spoke with both HM and HD on 3/2. All is going very well with Camila. She spent her training period mostly with HM's mom and they developed a great relationship. AP is getting to know the children and all seem to be adjusting to the change nicely. AP and HF have advance scheduling out, therefore AP was able to plan ahead with friends to vacation."
3600461,HM stated everything was going well.  No complaints or concerns at this time.  AD and HM discussed issue of HD walking around house in underwear and AP feeling uncomfortable about it.  HM stated it would not happen again and appreciated AD discussing issue with her.  HF and HC are really happy with AP.
3600460,HM stated that AP is having trouble adjusting to being away from her boyfriend and that she cries a lot.  HM stated she told AP that it will take her time to adjust to being here and once she does things will seem better.    HM stated she is trying to help AP get her documents in order -- ss card and NJDL.  HM asked for more info on DL process.  AD gave HM list of docs AP should bring to DMV but also recommended she call DMV first.  AD stated DMV can tell her if AP needs to take a written or road test and when she can do that.
3600455,"Had a talk with AP. AP is not happy with placement due to extra chores and attitude from the 3 boys. HF would like to make it work, but feels that AP is ungrateful and does not appreciate what the HF does for her. AD suggests a mediation on Thursday 3/6 at 7:30pm in their home."

HF has decided it might work best if the have one nanny and one live in AP, AP's last work day was Tues 2/25/2014 , HF housing obligation of 2 weeks was up on 2/25 but they agreed to let them stay till wed and that could be their travel day. AP's two weeks of floating was till 2/27"

3600033,Things are awesome. HF is so pleased with their AP - had nothing bad to say.

3600030,"Spoke with this HF on February 12. HF wanted AP to extend and were wondering if that was possible even though she had already booked her flight. I told them no, especially since AP is quite a bit away from finishing her coursework requirement. HF said they would interview other APs."
3600028,HF is sad to be spending last weeks with AP. Thy are hoping he will stay in the states to do an educational program.

Camila will be going to classes in SF soon so she will make sure she has at least one Sat afternoon and sunday off.

3599995,Things are still going well. HD continues to admire how solid and efficient AP remains.
3599987,see problem report. HF and AP have gone into re-match.  HF looked at my local ext AP Laura and has matched with her. I will co-ordinate the transition into her home if past HF doesn't want HF Sherry to pick her up. I had communicated to HM Sherry when she was looking at Laura that there was not flexibility on arrival time as her current HF paid for program timer through the middle of March.
3599983,HM says she takes good care of the kids and the kids like her but she is really hard to read. HM cannot get a read on her as she has some weird ways of interacting at times. she will be really friendly and then not say a single word during dinner.

(Concerns are the following:  AP using her phone during work hours, sleeping during work hours, not being attentive to the children, not informing the Hparents when the baby fell until days later, asking often to be out later than curfew, and not being a part of the family for special occasions) The HF continue to communicate and express their concerns with the AP in hopes that she will make more of an effort to show the same energy, initiative, drive, and family orientation she had when she first arrived with the family.  HM has shared that it seems now that she has made it to NY all of those positive qualities have disappeared.  HM wants to continue to work at the match but, it seems like its one sided.  HM shared she will sit down and talk to the AP again and see if they can come to a resolution.  AD will meet with them next wk to conduct a mediation if necessary.

I reminded her of the DOS guidelines that I went over with them at their HFI. Sara emailed me with some concerns regarding her match.

3598711,"Laura said that Jennifer is sweet and very nice yet she seems to lack some common sense things. She gave an example of Jennifer hitting a pot hole. (Very common right now with all of the snow) The problem is that she drove all the way home from school with the flat, instead of pulling off of the road and calling for help. The caused a great deal of damage to the car and HP""s can only charge her the $250. Deductible. The car is a good one and belongs to HM's mother. HM is now looking for a older car with over 100K miles for Jennifer to use. HM said that Jennifer is good with the kids, other than the fact that she does not plan for the common unexpected things like Mason running away when she takes him for a walk.  Laura's other concern is that Jennifer still does not attempt to prepare meals even for herself, unless Laura cooks or ask her to. Laura admitted that she is a perfectionist and likes things done a certain way so she prepares most meals. HM said that she & Jennifer only speak briefly as needed. She said that she is a very quiet person and very businesslike and is fine with things this way. She said that most of her close relationships, she is not the one who communicates. Felix and Jennifer communicate well. She said that perhaps Jennifer is intimidated by her because of her strong personality. I suggested Laura work on developing a connection with Jennifer since she is her HM & Jennifer expects this. Laura talked awkward silence and of uncomfortable moments during dinner and the ride to the gym. I suggested she ask Jennifer how she is feeling and if there is anything that she can do for her, also to ask questions about her class, her day and her friends, specifically when she returns home each day. Laura said that she would be uncomfortable with this. I made several suggestions as to how she & Jennifer could connect, by watching a favorite TV show together. Laura mentioned ""The Bachelor"". I suggested she ask Jennifer questions during the commercials, regarding what had taken place during the show. Laura said she would go to the Children's museum with Jennifer & the children tomorrow I suggested they walk into Starbucks for some hot chocolate afterwards, to do something fun and unexpected, other than just work related time.  She added that she does not know what Jennifer does when she is downstairs in her room, but that’s fine. I explained that Jennifer is not just an employee, but a family member and expects a relationship that makes her feel at home and comfortable. Laura did say that although she would not like to extend with Jennifer at this time, she does like the program."
3598710,Very Well.  The boys have been sick on and off with colds.  Cintia is very kind with them and has not gotten sick herself.
3598709,"Laura said that Jennifer is sweet and very nice yet she seems to lack some common sense things. She gave an example of Jennifer hitting a pot whole. ( very common right now with all of the snow) The problem is that she drove all the way hoe from school with the flat,instead of pulling off of te road and calling for help. The caused a great deal of damage to the car and HP""s can only charge her the $250. deductible. The car is a good one and belongs to HM's mother. HM is now looking for a older car with over over 100K miles for Jennifer to use. HM said that Jennifer is good with the kids, other than the fact that she does not plan for the common unexpected things like Mason running away when she takes him for a walk.  Laura's other concern is that Jennifer still does not attempt to prepare meals even for herself, unless Laura cooks or ask her to. Laura admitted that she is a perfectionist and likes things done a certain way so she prepares most meals. HM said that she & Jennifer only speak briefly as needed. She said that she is a very quite person and very business like and is fine with things this way.She said that most of her close relationships ,she is not the one who communicates. Felix and Jennifer communicate well. I suggested Laura work on developing a connection with Jennifer since she is her HM & Jennifer expects this. I made several suggestion as to how she & Jennifer could connect ,by watching a favorite TV show together. Laura mentioned ""The Bachelor"". I suggested she ask Jennifer questions during the commercials, regarding what had taken place during the show. Laura said she would go to the Children's useum with Jennifer & the children tomorrow I suggested they walk into Starbucks for some hot chocolate afterwards, to do something fun and unexpected, other than just work related time."

With this being said, Hmom is glad they made the decision to go ahead and match with another AP. Mom says they are looking forward to meeting new AP Alessia.  In the meantime current AP is now vacationing in Fla. with a friend of hers from Germany who came to visit. They come back on Monday."
3597510,All is well with AP Anna and this HF.
3597503,AD introduced herself to the HM and welcomed her to the area.  HM shared how things were going quite well.  Feels the AP is doing quite well with the children and is excited for the AP as she is having a week long trip to France to visit friends and family.  AP will return to NY at the end of next wk.  No concerns.
3597415,HM returned my call and said that everything is still going great.   No problems at all with AP.

Mom says they are all looking forward to their Hawaii trip, so tired of the cold weather.  Mom reports that AP loves her acting class thru Oakton CC.  Mom says AP had a great time bowling last night at our activity and enjoyed meeting the new APs in the group."
3597392,HD responded to my email with a phone call.  He asked what can I do for you?  I explained that I needed to speak with them every month in order to check in and make sure that all is well with the working relationship and responsibilities of themselves and their AP.  He stated that everything was and that they were finally getting settled in their new home.  They are looking to welcome a new au pair in May.  He also mentioned that Jovanna was in Serbia for her vacation.  I stated that's why I hadn't been able to reach her.
3597391,Hmom says things are going well with APs childcare.  Hmom feels AP has adjusted nicely into their family.  Hmom says she and AP are looking over classes at Oakton.  I told Hmom that non credit classes are fine as long as they are thru an accredited college and as long as they are of educational value. Told Hmom that online classes are not allowed to be put towards meeting APs Ed. Req.  Hmom reports that kids are definitely testing AP right now to see what they can get by with.
3597385,"AD spoke with HD about AP no longer wishing to extend with the HF.  HD and HM are both pretty upset and shocked as in their minds, things were going well.  They could understand the AP wanting to return home without extending but her wanting to extend with another HF is what they're having a hard time understanding.  Mediation scheduled for Sun, Mar 2 to bring everyone on the same page and discuss next steps."
3597380,"Hmom says APs childcare is going ok.  Mom just continues to feel at times that AP does not use good judgement when it comes to APs personel life, this is concerning to mom.  Hmom is not sure if she even has the right to get involved in APs  personal life?  Example: Mom reports that APs old boyfriend stopped calling AP, now a new boyfriend is in APs life that she just met.  AP has asked Hmom permission to allow boyfriend to come over to the house. Hmom is uncomfortable with this because she knows nothing about him.  Hmom reports that even with the previous boyfriend, AP left to go on a trip with him right after she met him.  Hmom feels AP should be more careful."
3597377,Things are going well. AP continues to be social and the kids are great.
3597374,"AD spoke with HD, everyone is happy and things remain great. No questions or concerns."

3597365,AD spoke with HM who is really happy with the placement. She says ap is really good with the boys and they love her. They all just spent the weekend together with friends skiing and everyone had a great time.
3597363,"HM reports that things have not been going so well with Nanny.  She reports that she is messy and doesn't help much in the home. They feel that she doesn't like to be with children and she doesn't smile much.  HM and AP having a problem with scheduling vacations. HM will give AP about 6 weeks of vacation but it is usually around the time she is not working. HM gave her a week in November, a week in December but told her that the week in November was her actual vacation time. AP is requesting a week in April for the week she picks. HM has agreed to this.  HM now says AP wants a week in June. HM said no but I can give you a week in July.  HM is asking for some assistance from AD to see if this is fair.  I told HM I would ask APC and see what their opinion is and get back to her.  I told HM that AP wants to extend in August and HM said there is no way. HM's words to me were ""don't be surprised if I call you in a couple of months and say that I don't need an AP anymore and leave the program"".  Hm reports that they communicate through text and emails because it is what the AP wants as her English is not strong. HM prefers AP's not to be around on HF private time. HM reports she gives car on weekends and nights and is pretty open. There is a 200 mile per week limit on driving."
3597360,Allcontinues to go well with Ramona. She has rellly become part of the family.
3597359,All is going great with Brenda and her HF. They are having conversations about her extending with them.
3597356,HM reports that Ashely is doing an OK job.  No problems with childcare but still learning the ropes. HM reported that AP was sick for 4 days and could not work. HM asked me if she could change the schedule around for this week and have her work the hours she missed over the weekend. I told her this was possible as long as it was within 45 hours and within the same work week. HM said ok. HM said it was also suppose to be her weekend off in March. I told the HM as long as she speaks to her about this and then give her another weekend off in March that it was ok.
3597355,Spoke with Seth. He said things are great with Caroline. They will be looking for another ap and would like a week of overlap. Seth said that it will be hard to find anyone as wonderful as Caroline. Told Seth about the early bird special. They will reapply probably next month.
3597352,APO went very well. Alana seems great. HM said she is fabulous with both kids.  the last AP from a different agency is training her. The baby is still 10 weeks so either HM or past AP is home with her at all times.  HM thanked me for taking Alana after APO to the Social Security office.  HM said she was happy that I was able to get her a ride to the AP meeting so she could meet and have friends in the beginning.
3597350,Everything is great. Julie has few more days left and she will be leaving. HF loved having APs but they will not need fulltime childcare any longer

3597331,Hmom says AP Isabelle has been doing a great job.  They took her to Hawaii with them and mom said she was such a big help especially during the flights.  Mom reports that they will have to speak with her regarding the use of deodorant.  Apparently AP says she cannot find spray deodorant so she has not been wearing any at all.  Mom said she will look for some spray or pump brand and give to AP to keep her from smelling at times.  Mom says AP had a great time at our bowling activity.
3597322,HM said Licia has been handling all of the snow days home with the kids like a champ.  She is great and they continue to think she is their best AP yet.  Nothing really to report otherwise.
3597316,Things  continue to be fine with Azusa and the host mom was excited to hear that Azusa initiated asking me questions about extending.  She was worried that perhaps the AP was just being polite when the HM asked her about extending.  HM thinks the AP is fairly happy now that she continues to socialize some with other APs.
3597315,APis wonderful.  Hm hopes she will consider extending with family
3597306,Doug said Karen's last day is March 6 and he believes she is planning on getting married March 7.  Their new au pair from another company arrives this weekend. He wished they could've stayed with us but felt they had to look elsewhere since we could not be flexible with our fees.
3597302,"Everything is ok, AP is having some difficult with th oldest kid, but AP and HF are working together to solve the problem."

She got the boys to sleep during the night instead of duting the daytime.  Elizabeth would love her to stay for more than one year but she does not think that is goiing to happen
3597262,HM excited extension was approved!  Everything is going well with AP. She is encouraging AP to go to the Western photo shoot with the North Houston APC group.  HM asked about AP's taxes.
3597259,HM apologized for not getting back to AD.  She stated her phone had been broken. She stated that the family is very pleased with AP and plan to extend with her for 2nd year.
3597257,Well.  She is used to them and they are used to her.  Always room for improvement but she doesn't want to rock the boat.  Steffi responds to the things she wants done and the kids are happy.  She thinks they both have a happy relationship too.
3597255,"Everything is great, discussing the extension.  Pretty sure they will extend.  Possibly going to Brazil before the year is up to renew her Visa.  Will discuss with her."
3597250,Ad spoek with TIm ( HD ) and he says all is well with Leti.  She mixes things up but she means well.  Owen is having some troubles in school and they are probably going to get a tutor for him.  NO real complaints.

The HF are all sad that Juliana is gone.  Marcella has found a free ESL class to take until June when she can get into CLC.  She is learning the area well and also getting used to the family's routines and schedules.   She already had made many AP friends in the area and seems very happy.

We are trying to prepare our children for her departure and a new Au Pair's arrival, but I know it will be very hard for all of us. Everything is going well as always and Lea is terrific"""

3597159,"AD spoke with HM. We spoke for a while about many things regarding APs personality, ability and her response to constructive criticism.

She also will be sure not to talk about ap in front of kids."

HM said that he does nothing;  thinks her friends and son's friends are his and has been inviting them to do things inappropriately.  Also worried about his eating habits.  He eats tons and then spends an hour in the bathroom.  He is scattered and forgetful, but Toby still really likes him.  HM is going to re-apply and spend more time interviewing.  She may want me to come there in a week or so to go over the expectations, but not sure as she doesn't think he will change."
3597011,"Things are going well. AP went to Portland and Forks with friends. AP is more task oriented and not as creative with entertaining the youngest. AP is happy with the family and communicate well. HM said everyone has had pneumonia and she is still sick and not feeling well, but doing better. HM confirmed they won’t have an AP after Elena because youngest will go to a different school so that all 3 kids are closer to home and there will be less need for driving. HM is mostly at home with the kids."

3596796,called Pam to see how everything is. Ianele is great and they are undecided of how to go about with new AP and had found a program that was less expensive etc. They have some kind of program that is less hrs per week for HF with school aged kids that they are interested in. I told them I do not know about these programs.
3596791,Spoke with Stacey. They had a nice time in Disneyworld. They went with another couple and the children did not get along so it was a little stressful. Priscila went down to Disneyworld the next week with a friend.

3596788,"Good, however HM was concerned that AP recently started dating a guy and that AP gave out HF home address for guy to pick up AP for a date.  HF has a rule that their home address is not to be given out without their permission.  HM also mentioned that AP seems to be texting quite a lot.  HM will speak with AP about this and will ask AD to mediate if needed."
3596786,called Tamra and she called back and all is good
3596783,"Marilyn says that things are not better with Larissa, but she's still in limbo regarding whether to break the match. She says that Larissa is good with the kids when she's with them, but not great about making sure they have what they need, though Marilyn says that Larissa is improving in this area. She continues to cite trust as the main issue, but says she feels so drained that she doesn't want to go over it again. Marilyn says she's offered an ultimatum to Larissa that if things aren't better by the end of April then she will request a match break. According to Marilyn, Larissa continues to say that she will work on things and continues to not really do so."
3596776,called Heather and we communicated and a bit back and forth abou things. She says all is good and Agnes is good and doing a good job.
3596749,"Anne said everything is the same, just hanging in there.  She did ask Alejandra to stop being on her phone in the mornings while Juliana is eating and getting ready for school.  So now she reads a book or whatever is on the counter.  Anne takes this somewhat personally.  I tried telling her mayb she is not a morning person, etc, but she also said she is grouchy.  She said she is snippy with Juliana when she was crying on her way out the door bacause she couldnt find her homework.  I suggested she discuss what is going on in the morning with her when they come back from Isreal.  They leave soo and will be gone until March 14 or so."
3596745,Well.  Asked for a sample packing list for Kyra.  Otherwise just trying to get prepared.
3596744,"Spoke with Kim.  She asked if ay of the costs were increasing for 2104 since minimum wage in CA went up, so I gave her the stipend amount which is the same as last year.

3596703,"Libby reached at work, stated that all was well with Sunny.  No problems at all.  (Surprising since the recent notes indicated unhappiness, but HM is aware APC is here to support them)"

Sae had questions about the flight request deadline, since Raquel won't have an answer from her school in Brazil until around 3/15 but the flight request deadline is 3/1. Aware of late fee. AD sent Sae, Matthew and Raquel the flight request info and discussed with Sae on the phone.  Sae is aware of Brazil's visa/reentry into US issues and will make sure that Raquel's visa is not expired before her trip home in March."

I cautioned her that this may be too much at once, but she assured me that all 3 will be in school and she will have more time for class then."
3596526,"HM and I spoke about some concerns that HM has in regards to ap's schedule and expectations. AP hasn't been what th HF was envisioning and hoping to be, so we will meet on Wed 3/5 at 8:30am to reveiew program regulations and expectation together.  See problem report note"
3596522,Great.  She wantes Deysi to extend and told her that (not jokingly) Sunday and Deysi said she was considering it.  Discussed process and cost and need to email it to her.  She does so well and it would be much better to know her already.
3596519,"AD spoke with HM, who can't believe how fast this year has gone by. HM is very happy that her son feels so comfortable and close with the AP. He will miss her a lot."
3596517,"Things are going much better. HF sat down and talked with AP and he is doing a better job. They are being a little more strict with house rules, as I suggested, and that way they are all on the same page."
3596510,"Good. HF has had to make a few tweaks here and there during the transition of AP's, but all is well, HF really like her and thinks she is doing great. AP is taking classes at School of teaching ESL."
3596495,Well.  Hm states all is going well - the AP is adjusting to their rules and hasn't had any issues this month at all.  She states the AP has been very flexible with her schedule which the family appreciates.  No concerns at this time.
3596483,HM stated that things are going fine.
3596477,HM stated that things are good and they have no concerns regarding Andrea. HM asked about the extension process. AD emailed RM for more details.
3596466,Annika is doing well. She is great with the kids and she has a big social network. She will stay until May and the HF's old au pair will help out over the summer . They might be pre matching with a friends of hers
3596457,They have extended with Bella.  She is really part of their family.   Michelle is traveling for work out of the country and is not reachable by phone or email until next week.
3596450,IT is good.  Martin is a very nice young man and does a good job.  Kay has been very stressed lately - working hard plus handling the death of a good friend.
3596446,very good-Spoke to host mother for a short time. HM have very bad cold and she is not working today. She will call me Friday to talk more. Her AP is wonderful.
3596434,Things are going great with Ale.  She went on a cruise with some of the other au pairs. Halle said that they have asked Ale to consider extending with them.  She will need to let them know by March.
3596392,Ben says that Natalia is doing great.  She has a great group of friends in the St Paul area and is really enjoying them.  She is also taking an English class and that has helped her a great deal.
3596391,"I got a call early this afternoon from Andrea to talk about her au pair, Miriam.  She saw Miriam interacting with her girls in a very negative way and is concerned about it.  She said that Miriam gets as angry or angrier than the girls.  Andrea had to talk with her about being careful bringing the girls downstairs because she saw her doing that one day and it looked like she was being hasty and HM was worried one of the girls would fall.  Emma told her Mom that Miriam grabbed her by the arm and pushed her into a chair yesterday.  HM told me that Emma was close to hysteria and she didn't know why.  She said the girls tell her they want their old au pair back and she also noticed that they are behaving poorly all the way around.  She thinks it is because Miriam doesn't know how to handle them properly.  She shouts and acts as immature as they do. I offered to come by to sit down with them to talk with her.  HM said she and the HD will speak with her tonight and if they need me to come by to mediate after that she will let me know.  HM had thought things were improving but what happened yesterday and last weekend has caused her great concern.  I asked her to let me know what happens after they speak with Miriam.  When I saw her 10 days ago she seemed to be adjusting well and happy.  She did tell me that she thought the girls were spoiled.  I know the family and the girls and while they are a handful, I don't believe they are spoiled."
3596387,"Laura has a friend visiting from Germany which has been nice for all.  They are headed to Chicago to visit this weekend.  One of the kids has been sick recently but otherwise, all is good.  They are looking forward to their trip to Puerto Rico next month. Laura will be traveling with them."
3596354,Spoke with Allison. She said that things are great with Marcella. She is on vacation this week and they are realizing how much they miss her! Allison is going back to work in an office in one month with Bristol-Meyers-Squib.. Marcella's schedule will change to 8:30-5pm.
3596327,Everything is wonderful.  She has been away on a business trip.  Having Susi has been such a good thing for our family.
3596313,"Daniela is doing well. She needs to practice driving and the HM has booked a driving lessons for tomorrow. She seems a little reluctant with the boys, but is very sweet and eager to help"
3596310,Spoke with Hm and everything is good. Had question about travel to Bahamas for Ap. Told Hm ok her visa is good for year.
3596288,"HM is currently in China, but HD is here. Everything is fine."
3596262,HM told me that Lucie is great. No concerns
3596253,Hm is very pleased with AP.  HM would like to extend but will wait until AP returns from March trip to have conversation.  Either way HM says she thinks a male AP is bet for her son
3596245,"Hm is very pleased with AP.  AP seems to have ""blossomed"" and is much happier.  Hm said she has made good friends in the area, knows her way around the area and just seems more settled"
3596244,Spoke with Hm and everything is good so far.
3596240,HM says AP fits in very well they have spend all day together since AP arrived and it's going really well. Today AP went to the gym while HM is at the Hospital.
3596232,HM said things are going well and they love AP.
3596228,HF is extremely pleased with AP.  HM wants to extend with AP already!!  AP has boyfriend at home so Hm is not sure if she will extend but Hm can hope!  HM has told one neighbor about the program but she still is not sure she wants anyone to live with her.  AD reminded HF about giving AD lead to input in system
3596219,"things are going great!  discussed matching by April 15 for the best discount-- she is already looking, but hasn't narrowed in on anything yet."
3596213,Spoke with Hm and everything is good so far. Hm has prior Ap train new Ap.
3596146,"all good, went on a family cruise last week to the caribbean on RC and it was fantastic, can't believe the winter we have been having and it was such a great break, Maike is wonderful, just finished her classes and all rules are being followed"
3596142,HM said everything is going really well.
3596135,Excellent.  HF is leaving for a ski vacation in Utah tomorrow.  Hm is excited to show AP the ski resorts out west.  The kids have been giving the AP hints as to how to ski.  Hm is pleased Ap will extend
3596133,"all good, went skiing in Killington and had lots of fun,wen about a month ago too when it was so cold, Karolina stayed home and had a break, things are going well and all rules are being followed, she is looking into classes and will call if she needs help with that"
3596116,"Everything is going very well,  HM said that there is nothing negative to say."
3596114,"Everything is going very well, there are no complaints at all.  HM stated that around the end of March they will begin the process of finding a new AP, as their AP's 2nd year will be ending with them this summer.  HM said she is very sad o think about this."
3596110,"AD spoke with HD who says he can not wait until Friday when the AP leaves. He had wanted it to be a nice week before she left, and that he is working on that with her. Because she has consistently broke things, HD does not want AP driving the girls to school or driving on her own. He has been doing all the AP duties, allowing her to just rest."
3596109,great!  Have asked AP to extend if she decides not to go to school straight away. Whole family in Germany with AP so that is exciting!
3596096,"AD called HM, she said that AP miraculously became well and didn't want to see a doctor. HM says this is after AD sent email with health information, suggestions and days off and days make up for illness information. HM says she was disappointed that the AP worked the next day, but then was gone all weekend, feeling great, HF have lost trust in AP. Not just for this reason, but HM explains that AP shows no interest in children. AP does her homework and other things when with the children. HM says often she will plan a play date, but on two occasions things happened and the AP had no idea how it happened. one of these things was nail polish all over the sofa, the other was a cut and bleeding on the child''s chin. AP was clueless, other HC says AP was in the other room talking. HF are not happy but are leery of approaching the situation, AD gave some suggestions, they will follow through with clear and honest communication"
3596090,"AD spoke with HD who says that they are amazed at how well the AP is with the triplets. He admitted that when he and his wife has the babies, there can be times of frustration and exhaustion, however the AP handles things so well. As the babies are introduced to new things, the AP is very flexible and listens to parents request. HF is extremely pleased"
3596088,"HM called AD to update her on AP's health, she says she is recovering well. HM apologized for HD's behavior, saying that he felt bad for how he treated AD but that he is a concussion specialist and he had major concerns. He conducted medial checks on AP, and HF will allow AP to get the rest she needs and the time she needs to get well. HF have bonded with the AP and just want her to be safe and healthy."
3596081,"AD spoke with HM, she says AP is showing more effort and interest in the children and parents. They spent some time at a musical together, it was the HM's treat, the AP was not working, just spending family time. HM likes how things are going, but fears that AP will be sad when her only friend departs in April."
3596078,"AD spoke with HM, who feels things are great. She feels the program works for her busy and flexible schedule. HF and AP are moving forward on their plans to extend. AP will complete her school and bring education papers to AD by mid March."
3596065,HM says things are okay.  AP has her drivers test tomorrow finally and she is really hoping AP passes because HM says it has been a real hinderance not to have her driving.
3596059,Nickol couldn't be happier with Kershia and she doesn't thing that there is anything that Kershia needs to improve upon.  Her and Darrell are so happy to have her here and see the relationship that she has with the children and them.  Her mother and sister will be visiting and they will stay with the HF in between there small trips that they have planned.
3596056,"Wll.  Isa is great and has blended right in with the family.  The only thin Andrea ever wants to know if when we will open up Destin, Flroida for her friend, Mike, who needs an au pair.  She asked about it again today."
3596051,The placement is going great. Julia's father is well and there are no worries at this current time.  Julia's mother is coming to visit next week and then her sister is coming to visit in a month and Julia will also be taking a trip home to visit with her family.
3596042,Everything is going great.
3596039,HM reports overall that the placement is going well and children are adjusting well to the new AP.  AP is quieter than former AP so HM has been working with her on asserting herself with the children especially in mornings when it is time to get them ready.    HM reported that the AP hit a tree in the driveway while backing out.  It dented the vehicle but the family does not plan to have it fixed at this time as there are a few other dings.  AP was apologetic and immediately told HF what happened.  She was trying to  back out of driveway which is curved and HM says can be difficult instead of pulling vehicle out of garage and turning it forwards before exiting the driveway.  HM has offered for her company to sponsor the March event to Schilliterbahn Waterpark in Galveston for the Houston South au pairs. She has also offered to hold a barbeque at their home this summer as one of the monthly events.
3596034,great
3596030,Monica is so happy with Jules and she is pleased that she now has a better understanding of what the program can be.  She has no complaints.  It is wonderful.
3596016,"Things are going great, HM hopes the AP will extend but the AP is not sure yet. AD and HM spoke about starting a new search if the Ap is undecided much longer"
3595998,"Things have been going relatively well, other than the car issues where the HM feels that the AP drives too much for her personal use without filling up the tank.  Then today something else major happened.  AP used the HM's SSN to add the international calling plan to her cell phone without permission.  HM is extremely mad and concerned about identity theft and asked AD to speak to the AP about it and regroup later to figure out her options."
3595997,"Courtney reports that everything is going well, that Bojana is doing great with the kids, no concerns or issues."
3595996,Gina Puzo reports that everything is going well. AP Kate went to Chicago to visit and enjoyed. No concerns

3595988,"Things are going great, HF and AP have just started their second year together."
3595987,HM says things are going well.  She said Kate was so happy when Kami returned from vacation.  HF does NOT plan to get another AP when Kami leaves.
3595977,Nikki callled back and said everything is great.  Things are on track now with Hana's classes now so she thinks they have got that settled.
3595975,HF and AP had a great time in Orlando.  They love her!
3595974,HM says AP continues to do a great job with girls.  They are going to do some traveling next month.
3595973,HD is very happy with AP and how she enjoys being part of the family.
3595972,HM is happy with AP.  She's doing good with Maya and Zoey.  HF will most likely move in March.
3595971,Everything is good.  HD said they would be sending in AP's ext app today.
3595970,Everything is great.  They all had fun with the snow since that's new to AP.
3595969,I spoke with Kelly and discussed some questions she had about taxes for the host family.  Also she is having an issue with Marta with body oder.  Offered some tips for discussing with her.  HF had a birthday party which they invited the AD to and it was very pleasant and ap clearl enjoys the entire family
3595966,Things are going great HF love the AP and would love her to stay another year.
3595957,Kristyna is settling in. Spent weekend at inlaws beach house in Monterey. Scheduled O/A for 2/26.
3595955,All is going well. Laura did have minor accident in car 2 weeks ago. She felt very bad and they warned her not to follow so close. She are not sure if they will report to insurance or just pay for damage to both cars involved.
3595954,Met with Sara and HF to discuss schedule and holidays re work guidelines. Explained to Sara that she can be expected to work if requested. Suggested Phil give Sara a defined schedule so she knows when she is off work. Reviewed duties and reminded Sara that she needs to be more considerate and tell HF when she is planning on coming home from being out. Suggested they have weekly meetings and for Sara to be more proactive and create a reward sticker board with kids. They will also create a petty cash envelope for incidentals. Meeting went well.
3595951,HF had a very good start with Olalla. They hope that everything will stay this way.
3595949,Everything is well with Sabine. HM thanked me for being available to them any time they call and for being a good friend and support to Sabine. They would like to extend for another year with her but she is still thinking about it and tying to get her dad's approval. Fingers crossed
3595948,I thanked Hf for a new referral. Bianca is doing well. Her face is normal again with some small scares.
3595947,Rosanne said she really was hoping Edith would extend but she thinks she wants to go home and get a job to help her family and another year is too much. I reminded her that Edith can extend for 6 mos. She is going to ask her if she is willing to consider 6 mos extension or begin looking for next AP by end of March.
3595946,ammy is completing her program. HF had a very positive experience but they will not continue with the program for now.
3595945,Everything is well. HF is happy with Alvaro. He does a good job so far. Sometimes he is little slow and does not get everything done from the schedule but h is catching up
3595944,hF is happy Emanueles extension is approved and completed. They can relax now. She is doing well and everyone is happy.
3595943,Everything is well. Moe is catching up with the schedules and duties. Sometimes HM thinks it is too much for Moe but she has not complained yet

3595941,"Jenni is doing a very good job. She is respectful and very loving with the kids. HF said it feels she has been living with them forever.

3595940,Everything is ell. Lukas is a great driver and he is good with the kids. HF is happy

3595903,HM says everything is going great.  HM says AP is happy and has a boyfriend.  HM says she is going much better after her surgery and is back to work.
3595901,"Robin said that things are somewhat better with Itana, since they have had a few conversations. Bob feels Itana may just leave. The kids will go to camp, at GA, this summer for a few weeks in July.They will vacation in Aug. , so they may be able to manage without an AP. I suggested an ICAP with a limited time remaining."
3595897,"Jasmin is doing better again.  Things are crazy because we had a water pipe break and have wet floors.  Also the kids have been having a hard time, but hopefully things improve quickly"
3595891,HM reports all is well with Tereza. No concerns or issues. she is like a daughter and best friend to HM. She is great at her job and has been very flexible.

She was wondering if I had any information for au pairs who are interested in converting their J-1 visa for student or other exchange visa in order to stay in the US longer. I advised her that per DOS regulations, au pairs have agreed to return to their home country at the completion (or termination) of their program."
3595881,Anika says everything is very well. She's relieved that APC was able to straighten out Fran's extension without too much difficulty. She can't imagine handling everything without Fran's help!

I told HM that she needs to make sure the Khem is attending the AP meetings.  Driving is good and there are no issues or concerns. Told HM I will help her register for school next month so she can attend in the Spring.
3595875,"better.  They have been sitting down each week and reviewing the issues, and the AP's progress.  AD also met with AP and AP is understanding and responding well.  They are working on organization, being on time.  AP just got driver's license today.  There was a problem with her name not being spelled right on paperwork, so that caused a delay."
3595871,HM Happy with Lea. They would love for her to extend but they don't think she will as they live further away from other AP's and she wants to get back to her school in Germany. Kids adore her and all is great. HM and I spoke about reapplying and also the RF process for Lea.
3595866,"HM reapplied but not sure if Ivan will extend or not but she wanted to start looking just in case he decides to return home. They may consider a 6 month ext. but HM doesn't want to look for a new AP at Christmas. I told HM I would help her look as well and tried to advise her of continuing with a male Au Pair or an older Female AP. Stay away from under 21 as many girls under 21 can't handle the 4 kids, 2 dogs and a louder house."
3595865,Great.  AP is doing really well.  HM talked about the recent snow days and how that has effected her children's school schedule.  HM said kids are happy for the snow.
3595864,Ap is wonderful and is helping HM find a the next AP.  AD agrees and believes AP is a true leader in the cluster HM said she has decided to match with the next AP .  AD says HM needs to contact ME to get match started.  HM is sad to see current AP leave but excited to find a match
3595862,HD reports everything is great with Lea. They wish she could stay longer than 6 months. HD and I spoke about continuing with the AP program after Lea leaves and the process how to reapply.  Kids adore her and will be sad to see her leave.
3595861,HM feels things are improving.  HM does feel that AP needs to get better control over the kids night time routine.  HM would like AP to be more independent and take the lead with the children without waiting for direction.  AD did advise that AP is still new in the home and trying to learn the routines.  AD encouraged HM to continue with the weekly check ins with AP.
3595860,HM reports all is well with Steffi. They want to ask her to extend but not sure if it is too early to ask her. We spoke about deadline and RFR.  HM reported they would offer for her to go back to Germany in her 1st year if she extended with them.
3595858,"HF says they are doing good. They left Atl just before the last storm. Celine stayed with kids at in-laws. They were snowed in together. AP is responsible, drives well. AP went to Mardi Gras this weekend. AP was like, ""everyone was so drunk."" AP doesn't go out too much. She is calm and confident. AP is super flexible. She goes to yoga. Doesn't use the car very much. She does yoga at the same time as the kids."
3595855,HF is very happy with AP. HM likes that AP is always smiling and is very happy.  The girls really like AP and HM feels that this will be a good match.
3595854,"Hm is back to work and is very happy with AP. HM is very challenged at work and happy to have a strong AP at home.  Ap was in a ""fender bender"".  HM knows she can only ask AP to pay for $250 for the damages.  Thankfully no one was hurt and HF reported accident to insurance agency. The accident was minor."
3595852,Everything is great with Carol.  The HFM is now home from her surgery and doing better.  She does want some details n having 2 APs at the same time this summer though.
3595851,I spoke with the HF dad who said everything is goinggreat.  They are building a new house but do not have plans to move into it for another few months and they will keep me updated.  The HF mom called back later to ask if the AP is allowed to travel to Jamaica so I told her I would ask and let her know.
3595849,Great.  HM does not have any concerns.  AP is wonderful and the kids have been having so much fun in the snow.
3595844,"Edward and the family are all well.  They are pleased that Ivy's paperwork is completed and submitted and we are all waiting to see that she will be staying another year.  Edward, Paige and Bryce will be on a ski trip the week of March 9th and Ivy will be on a trip her with friends in California."
3595842,Elissa and her family are in Florida enjoying the warm weather until March 9th when they return to Chicago.  Elissa is very frustrated with Janine and very concerned as to whether she can make it a year with her and her behavior.  Elissa feels that Janine has fallen back into her old habits of taking advantage of her Host family.  She left work early one day and texted Elissa that she had left when she was supposed to work another hour.  Janine has also been staying out very late into the early morning with new friends as well.  Janine was very ill over the past month and put off going to the doctor until she was so sick that she had no other choice.  Elissa was frustrated that Janine was trying to go out with her friends when she should have been home resting and was unable to work as well.  Elissa knows that she must have a conversation with Janine and explain to her that she is at a crossroads and is contemplating ending her program year early if Janine can not get back on track.  Elissa stated that Janine is also trying to go to her home country in the month of April.  I have explained to Janine multiple times that this is not acceptable and that she runs the risk of not being allowed to reenter the country if she is unable to renew her Visa within a 2 week period.  She is also asking for vacation time before it is earned.

3595828,"Spoke with Stephen. He said Fatima is doing good. He asked what the extension fees were if they were to extend. He thinks the fee is still too high. I explained to him of the benefits of having a continuous au pair to look after the children and the area she is already used to, etc.."
3595822,"HM reported that the transition between APs was smooth, that they are liking their new AP and that things are going smoothly."

Suggested that Robin maybe even interview one of the available Serbian au pairs."
3595810,Spoke with Megan. She said everything is great with Jessica. Jessica was on her way to a piano class.
3595808,HF and AP are doing great.  No problems.
3595806,Good.  HM asked about ESL classes for AP as AP cannot seem to find any.  AD emailed Hm some options and reminded her that courses taken at churches ect would not count towards AP's requirement but could better her English.
3595804,"HM said everything is fine.  AD was happy to hear HF has decided to stay in the program.,"
3595803,Good.  HM said all is going well still.  She asked a littlle about APs taxes so AD resent the tax info email for her.

Ad wanted to make sure AP was getting out and meeting people in the community.   HM said that HF has a wide circle of friends and AP has enjoyed spending time with family and friends on the weekend.  HM said HD mother passed away suddenly this month so AP has been spending time with HD father and grieving with the family

3595783,HM is happy with program and AP.
3595781,Good.  HD said everything is still going great with AP.
3595771,I spoke with HM. Carol is wonderful and they are very happy with her. She is taking the driving written test next week and will hopefully pass the first time.
3595768,HD said the AP is fabulous and the kids really love the AP.  AP really helps with the transition with the divorce.
3595762,Placement is going well. HD still doesn't know what they will do for childcare. HD will call me if he needs an AP.
3595757,Everything is going great. HF is very happy with AP and they don't have any concerns.
3595752,I spoke with HM. All is well. Marta failed her driving test because she made a mistake on the bike lane. She has the next appointment already set up.
3595746,Good.  HM sais all is good.  AD remnded HM about early bird dscount and HM said she is hoping to begin searching soon.
3595743,"I spoke with HM, she told me that they are all sick and Sonja is being incredibly helpful and they love her."
3595739,"great, she is doing a great job."
3595738,Tom called and said that things are going well and they will really miss Aline.  I told him that we had a nice time at the Panera meeting and talked wedding dresses!  Everyone is looking forward to some good weather.

3595735,"great, she is awesome!"
3595734,"Good, great, Lulu still great with kids and fits in as family member"

3595726,"Erin saidnthat things seem to be going better, she did not have to talk with Jess as she seemed to pick up the pace after Christmas and is getting the children to help with putting the toys away, etc.  She has a nice group of friends.  jessy is doing the Mass Bay course"
3595724,"great, AP is doing so well, a important part of our family."
3595719,"HM said she didn't know when the AP meeting was.  AD sent the schedule again.

3595712,"good, the little problems have straightened out and the AP is stepping up to the plate more."
3595706,"good, no problems.  There is still a certain amount of parenting, but the problems seem to be settled.  HD mentioned that March 20 Jesse (one of the host children) will have a very difficult surgery guaranteed 100% to have complications.  HD asked AD to check in on AP more from March 20-April 5 because the parents will be so involved with the hospital, that they won't be supporting the AP like normal.  One of their adult children, plus the nurse, and homeschool teacher will all be there, so AP will have plenty of support and her work hours will not change, but worries over Jesse will add stress."
3595704,great
3595700,going well
3595698,"good, no problems but not planning on signing up with APC again.  HM has looked at ICAP, and it seems like there are problems with the Aps like they experienced before, and they don't want to do that.  OF course, there are many advantages of using APC, such as the children love it, but they are looking around at other options.  The AP is doing a good job now."
3595660,good-Patrick is still trying to help the kids see him as the authority. They test the limits some but he is getting a little firmer and more consistent with them.
3595624,Things are going very well Ap has adjusted . HM had no questions or concerns
3595619,"Things are going great like always, AP has been the best Ap they have had"
3595618,"Hm was walking into a meeting and will call AD back, All is going well"
3595617,Good. AP just returned from a week in CA. HM hasn't caught up with her yet.  HM matched with new AP from S Africa is excited to meet her
3595605,Things seem to be getting a little better as far as taking initiative goes and Kevin says that the children like her and she seems to be doing a good job with the stuff inside the house but they are still very disappointed in the fact that she is not able to drive.  I told him that I would follow up with Monica to see how many lessons she has taken.  I told him I would also follow up with the education as Kevin did not seem to think she had taken many classes.
3595597,AP just submitted her extension forms. HM says she did hers online as well. AD does not see anything indicating that extension paperwork has been received and is being processed yet. AD will follow up with HF and AP prior to Fri

3595580,"AD spoke with HM, she is concerned that the car restrictions are getting to the AP. HM mentioned that she sees AP on social network during her work hours, but says she is so great with the kids, that she feels it must be when there is a free moment, or nap time. HM is going to talk with AP about understanding why she can't always use the car and HM has learned so much through the experience that she will do things differently in the next placement"
3595577,great. They are extending with AP
3595569,Good HM says Olivera is very helpful and willing to be flexible with the family's schedule.  HF is moving from Nevillewood to Sewickley.  HM thinks Olivera will really enjoy the variety of shops and restaurants in the area.

3595564,"AD spoke with HD, who says things are fine except for AP recently came to him regarding schedule and wanted more weekend time. AD and HD spoke about the AP's need to have a written schedule. HD said he has done that, and that the schedule is consistent, although the AP's problem is that if she is scheduled until 8pm and the HD or HM offered to do the work with the kids and give her an early night, she gets annoyed."
3595563,"AD called to welcome AP, A/O conducted on 2/25/14 all seems well and off to a good beginning."

HOwever, host mom said that Sandra is a good communicator and she takes input and applies what she is being asked to do."

3595458,Ryan says ... Tati is great. She continues to be an   extraordinary au pair and a true blessing to their family. Her dedication to their children is only exceeded by her affection for them. His only disappointment is that they will have to send her home eventually.

3595241,IT is going well. She does want Amila to show more initiative.  They all went on a family trip during the Winter break down the coast.  Amila was more one of the children than a care giver.  They may not take her again. She was not a big help as they needed her to be.
3595237,Going well.

AP does not tell them where she is going when she is out as they have requested.  HD says they don't want to keep tabs on her but would just like to know where she is as a precaution in case something happens.  Also, HD cited a few incidents this month with the kids (carrying a knife through the house with the blade pointed out and walking against traffic with the kids in a crosswalk).

3595104,"HM returned from Europe trip and AP has been very ""unpleasant"" and has an ""attitude"".  HM hopes this will not continue.  AD will call AP to discuss."

3595024,Christine is doing well and had a nice time on a mini vacation/business trip to FL. She said that Mirta bonded more with the children when she was gone and they are going to go over some things that she needs to be aware of such as the children getting sick etc.
3594993,AP's parents visited for one week this month.  HF hosted APs parents and they had a good time.  Ap has blossomed in her job.  AP has decided she will return home and not extend.

3594963,"HD says things are going fine, but AD senses that friction is starting to build.  First AP was coming home bringing beer bottles to recycle and she is underage.  In discussion, she said that she does not drink, but has been with au pairs that were drinking and she just brought home the bottles to recycle.  HP believe AP is telling the truth.  But now AP has complained about her work schedule because it is not written down and sometimes she doesn't know when she will be off.  Also AP has asked if HF has to pay for her college book.  AD spoke to HD about both matters, and HD explained and will correct."
3594961,It is going well. Ap's boyfriend is currently staying at HF's house and AP took a week off last week to travel with him. HM is hopeful she won't miss him too much after he leaves.

HM said that AP always asks before having friends over, and that no alcohol is served to underaged au pairs.  AD has heard the same thing from another HF."
3594929,Spoke to HD.  HM is traveling this week.  I reminded him that the extension deadline is 2/28.  He said his wife is taking care of everything and that he would check with her they have every intention of extending for 6 months.

3594920,"All is well except for a couple of things that HM and I discussed: 1. having Daria's mom visit over the summer for no more than 2 weeks. 2. limit daria's use of the car when she is with the kids, to avoid potential damage. 3. travel over the summer with Daria to LA and Louisiana for HPs' work"
3594908,"All is going well with Rikako, no really issues.  AP is doing okay as usual.  HF has started looking for a new AP again and AD offered her help"
3594906,All is going okay so far and AP is doing well and adjusting. AD set interview for the 26th in the evening.
3594903,AP is just fabulous and family could not be happier with her.  She is great with both girls and does an excellent job at all times.
3594890,"Okay, AP has been a bit better with things, not the go getter they have had in the past. AP is good with the kids and the kids like her."
3594886,HM says all is going well with Mary and she's been great.  They went to Sun Valley recently.
3594874,HM says she is having a talk with AP today about her mom's visit.. HM is very nervous about it.  HM and I will  tallk later this week.
3594873,AP is great with the girls.  HM said if the girls act out the AP is firm but gentle with her correction and always discusses it right away with the HM.  On the other hand the AP has not yet unpacked.  The HM asked her about it and the AP said she's not sure where to put her summer clothes.  The AP has a very large walk in closet so the HM is not sure what the issue is but she is mildly concerned.  AP has not yet opened a bank account and has not signed up for school.
3594871,"HD thinks it is going great. He was out of town for a few weeks. She is still really quiet and stays to herself a lot, not engaging with kids much. Other than that everything is fine. HD is trying to get his son to warm up to her. He hides from her a bit. They did not bond real well. HD has been back for 2 weeks. Daughter is good with her. 9 year old son, and mother are still not thrilled with AP. AP seems to be happy enough. She doesn't take a lot of initiative.For example HM will return home and there are dishes still out from breakfast. When HD asks her to do it, she does immediately.  For example he asked her to organize his son's clothes, and went by 45 minutes later and it was done. AP is super clean, respectful, and nice. We talked about activities HC likes and she might be able to engage him in. He likes arts and crafts, tv, video games. AD suggested doing crafts or outings. If AP tries to watch tv with him, son will get up and move to a different tv set.  AD suggested that he might tell his son, to please give her a chance as she is trying. He says he has done that. She needs to bond with son or HM and all will be fine. We discussed mediation, possibly rematch. The incident that really upset HM, is that Nick stayed home sick one day, and when HM came home Nick said he was hungry and that AP didn't feed him. HD asked AP about it, and AP said she offered but he turned her down. He has seen similar behavior in the mornings at breakfast. All of them are going to New Orleans this weekend. He hopes they will bond there, but if not, we will need to meet when they all get back."
3594862,great
3594861,"Good, Ap is great with kids. AD mentioned to HM that another HF commented on Lara being great with her kids. HF has matched for summer arrival,"
3594860,"All is going great so far, HF really likes AP and she is doing well in the family and a good fit."
3594851,AP is extending with HF just deciding the length of time.  AD reviewed process for extending with HD Hd is very pleased that AP will extend
3594850,"Good, AP has been good, hf sat her down for a reminder talk about her house rules , that went well."
3594822,Spoke with Jenn. She said that things are great with Teele. The kids have had a lot of snow days and she has been great. Teele had and accident. she stopped for a squirrel in the road and was rear ended. Jenn knew the woman who hit Teele. I asked about school. Teele has not signed up for classes yet. Suggested encouraging her to look at the weekend classes. They are going to get another ap after Teele. Told them about the early bird special.
3594786,"Hmom reports that all is well with AP and her childcare.  Mom says as each day goes by they get to know AP more and more and feel very lucky to have her. Hmom says the baby has really grown to love AP. Mom was wondering if she could host a backyard  BBQ for all the AP's in the summer and I said ""sure thing they would love it"""
3594775,"Great! HF feels AP has fit in real well. She is very responsible and helpful. Youngest child has taken a little time to warm up to her, and HF is aware of this. HF thinks son is going through a rough patch, and don't blame AP. AP has made friends and is settling in well. Has not signed up for classes yet, but most likely for Spring."
3594759,"Everything is going so great, she is just wonderful.  She passed her driving test yesterday and hm will be adding her to her insurance today.  Asked again regarding Medical Payments amount to add on.  The kids all adore Toon and she's a great help around the house, even after hm has told her she's off work.  HF could not be happier."
3594756,"AP says things are great.  AP is considering extending but doesn't know for how long.  AP wants to go home to Denmark and I advised her to go in July, before her passport expires."
3594754,"Perfect, AP will have family in town from brazil and they will stay with HF. Ap got her CT DL and all is going well."
3594749,HM said things are going fine. HM said she is enjoying getting to know AP and that she is a mature girl who she can have a mature conversation with. HM said she is pleasant to be with and the children are getting to know her better every day.
3594745,"Dana is doing great with her job, and the family.  HM thinks she's staying home a lot for two reasons - one she is going to be ding a lot of traveling this spring and is saving up, and second, she is ""disappointed"" that the other girls in the group are so much younger than she is, and the others who are older have boyfriends now, so she's finding it harder to go out with them."
3594742,"Good. HF is happy with AP and she is doing a good job. I had some car insurance questions, and HF helped me out. AP is taking classes to be a certified trainer and is very happy. It was more then her stipend, so she had to pay extra."
3594736,"Great. AP was unable to make last event as we had to re-schedule because of snow, and she was already going on vacation with HF for the weekend. HD felt bad and let me know. AP is still taking English classes and will not extend with HF."
3594706,"everything is great!  They are finally ""back on track"" and things feel really good with this au pair.  She is great."
3594695,"Great, just getting settled in still. HF and AP are going on vacation next week to Cali. All are excited and think it will be agreat way to get to know one another. AO is this Thursday"
3594686,"Great! HF just loves Aleja! HM hosted an information AP meeting for potential HF's, and it was a great success. AP came out for awhile and also answered questions form potential HF's. HM just took kids and AP, and some of her friends to Portland for the weekend. AP will take classes in the Spring."
3594680,"Everything has settled down again.  Had a rough patch this month.  HF feels Lou is having ""short timers disease"" and is anxious to go home, but nervous after 2 years abroad.  She knows things will be different and moving in again with her parents had her stressed.  She has acted out recently by being late for curfew on weeknights (family believes this is as a result of her new ""39-year old boyfriend"" reminding her that as an adult who is 26 that she shouldn't have a curfew, etc.); she broke their $700 phone and was flippant about, handing it to the host mom and telling her ""it doesn't work, I need a new one"") and being overall ""short"" with her attitude.  She and the HM had a long discussion and have resolved most issues satisfactorily.  HM admits it is very stressful and ""hormonal"" since she is a week overdue with the baby at this point."
3594677,All continues to go well and HF is very happy with AP's performance. AP is taking business classes now and she is very happy about that. No vacations currently planned.
3594667,"Good, AP has been doing a better job and HM is happy. Unfortunately, HM matched with an AP from a different agency. She wants a German AP and didn't find our pool of German AP's big enough. AP continues to take ESL classes."
3594662,"All continued to go well. Both HP are done with family leave and AP is in charge of baby and toddler all day. AP is doing a great job, and everyone is happy. AP has some medical/insurance issues, but I am continuing to work with her and hopefully we can get it solved."
3594661,Ana Maria is going on to the next phase of her life with the HF blessing. she will get married this spring. and be part of their lives.
3594660,"HM says all is going well and she can't believe how smoothly the transition has gone to the new AP.   HM says AP is going out a lot and socializing is a lot. But HF is okay with that, but finds it a bit of bummer.  But they do enjoy their space.  HM says they might move to another country.  HM says they probably wouldn't extend with AP since she wants to be home for xmas."
3594659,"Hdad reports that AP is starting to drive herself around. Dad says she Rec'd her SS# and will find a time to take the driver's test now.  Dad says APs childcare is great, that the kids really like AP.  Dad feels AP has settled nicely into their family.  Dad says AP will be coming to activity."
3594658,"Good.  AP is now dating someone new and there is no more drama in the house.  AP is very happy and continuing to do well.  The one thing HM is working on with the AP is her strong language and where it's appropriate to use.  Otherwise, things are great."
3594654,"Good. HF is about to go on vacation to Mexico. While HF is in Mexico, AP will also make a quick trip down there, to re-enter with the correct documentation. Hopefully this will finally solve the passport/visa issue. Finally figured out AP came in on border card, and that is why she is not in system."
3594650,Good!  AP is settling in nicely.  The whole family will be traveling to the beach next week to escape the cold.
3594648,HM says all  is going well.  HM just started her first day back to work after 3 months at a new job so is pretty wiped out.   HM  says girls have transitioned easily with move.
3594645,Very well. AP continues to do a great job. HF is very happy. AP is taking child development classes. No vacations scheduled right now.
3594635,"All continues to go well. HF has started search for next AP, qualifies for early match. Will be hard to let old AP go. AP is taking fitness classes."
3594630,"Good, AP is getting out more. Ap is taking ESL listening and speaking classes. HF is gone on weekends a lot, skiing. So AP has had most weekends off. ALl is well."
3594623,HM says all is going well.  AP is happy with her classes at Exp College.  HM and I had bad connectionn so call was very short.
3594608,Everything is on track and no problems. AD told HM that she will be in touch prior to new APs arrival.
3594593,"great Kalsie is adjusting well to the family, it is hard to learn to drive in the snow however"
3594592,Elisabeth said everything is good.  She said Rose is great and Cate has been on her best behavior for a month and a half.
3594576,"Spoke with Jacqueline.  Everything is going great with Maxi.  They really love her.  They want to ask her to extend, so I told her the timeline for getting the extension process."
3594569,HM says AP continues to do a great job.  They are talking about extending.
3594567,great the sister in law and bro in law are moving moving in so Gianna will sharing a bathroom
3594566,Host dad  called and expressed concerned over his AuPair getting into an English class to get credit for their certificate.  I told him I would address this with Leslie.  HF plans to move in May or June and will let me know when they get the address.
3594562,Things are good.  HM  had questions about next meeting - March 16.  HM says AP is good with the kids.
3594547,heather apologized for not being available as she was really busy.  he said that she cannot even begin to think about Celeste leaving but us excited about Gabriela coming in April
3594544,Things are good.  HF and AP are visiting SFO for a little vacation and are excited to extend.
3594537,HM says AP is excellent and a good fit.  They have her signed up for driving lessons in March.
3594527,Hm says things are great.  She was happy AP was able to visit NOLA and experience Mardi Gras.
3594524,"HM called me back. She is unexpectantly pregnant with their 3rd and on medical leave for nausea. HM stated that Fiona hasn't been able to pass her driving test yet, failing the first 2 attempts. HM has been driving with her to drop off the kids and is still not confident that Fiona is a strong driver and rpefer to have her stop driving the children altogether and asked me for advise on how to do that. HM also mentioned that Fiona has been asking them about extending but HM is not sure yet. We talked about deadline and the fact that HM doesn't know what her needs will be in a few months and doesn't want Fiona to keep asking her about extending. I suggested to HM to tell Fiona that they will make a decision the first week of May, which will leave ap plenty of time to self-extend if HF doesn't want to keep her or continue in the program."
3594523,HM is happy with AP.  She is off to a good start.
3594517,"Hmom says AP Alina is great, that she is looking forward to her parents visiting her in the U.S. in April.  Mom says AP will take her vacation then and meet her parents in Fla. Mom reports that Alina continues to provide great childcare for them.  Mom says AP continues with her Sociology class thru Oakton.  She is not sure if AP will be attending our monthly activity."
3594513,"Spoke with Maggie.  Tana's mom is visiting right now, and Tana will soon decide if she is going to extend.  Maggie asked when she can start looking for new APs and if it will be hard to get one for July.  I told her she can start looking as early as she wants and that she will have plenty of time to find someone good."
3594512,"Things have improved tremendously with the HF and the AuPairs. HF is very happy with the progress that has been made.  Host dad sai d that they maybe moving to South Florida, and wanted to know if the APs would be able to transfer. I told him to let me know whenever he found out for sure."
3594506,"Spoke to Hdad, all is well with AP Iva.  Dad says AP is always consistent with her childcare and is so reliable.  He reports that she is truly a family member. He says she will be coming to our monthly activity."
3594479,Sandra was very sick on her first night with the Desmond family. She was much better the next day and was able to attend soccer games with the family.  Planning on doing Arrival Orientation on 2/25 at 6 pm.
3594474,Spoke with HD Marc. He said that things were great with Sam and the boys. She is terrific. She put together a You tube video of her and the boys rapping. It was hilarious!
3594461,"Everything is going really well, they are sad to lose Heiny but understand she's 25 and needs to get on with her life.  HM will go online today and renew her app, we discussed what she's looking for (see matching notes) and she would like Annika to select for her as she's so busy.  HM apologized for not getting back to me last night, just a busy evening."
3594452,Everything is good at their house.  The driving of Ollie to school is working out well.  It is a bit expensive but it's working.  Andrea is doing a good job with Ollie. They are going to take her to a dentist.
3594449,"Things are going well, nothing new to report. Ap seems to be going out and has made lots of friends"
3594439,"they have had an amazing experience and would really like her to extend. she is not sure yet. they will probably ask her to let them know by mid March. They would consider OS but really would like an EXT AP, one who is already set with driving and SS card etc."
3594434,"Spoke at length with Cynthia. Disucussed events from 2 weeks ago. HM stated that she understands that people get sick and expressed this to Bruna. She was upset that Bruna was sick and then decided to go out or have a friend over. She had asked Bruna to stay in and focus on getting better so that she could work the next week. Cynthia stated that she respects Bruna’s privacy and has never interfered with her going out but was irritated that Bruna wanted a friend overnight when that is against their house rules. She said that Bruna has had 20 days off this month b/c of their travel/vacation schedule and feels that she was upfront with Bruna when they matched about the job and her expectations. HM stated that she is not emotional and “family orientated.” She said that she is business like and was clear with Bruna about this. She said that she has wanted a partnership with Bruna but she has had to reinforce and  micromanage most of Bruna’s responsibilities. HM stated that she had no idea Bruna had a boyfriend or had broken up with him, nor did she understand that Bruna was having a hard time as Bruna did not communicate any of this. HM stated that Bruna’s English has continued to be problematic and that she does not communicate well in general. HM stated that she thinks Bruna is the sweetest ap she has ever had and has continued to try b/c of this. Discussed housekeeping tasks outside of DOS regulations. HM understands that Bruna cannot do anything outside of the DOS regs and will abide by the guidelines. She said that she really wants the best for Bruna but doesn’t know if she can continue for another 4-5 months with the match.  She is going to speak with Bruna and see how things go the rest of this week and will touch base with me next week."
3594432,very good-host mother will miss au pair. HF and AP have very good match.
3594428,The HM and AD spoke about the twins for about 15 minutes.  One of the twins is having reflux issues.  The HM reported that all is well with the AP and she is happy that she has many friends now.
3594426,Thing are great. Tatiana is going to Jamaca in APril with her friend and really looking forward to i.e.. Jill said she is doing a great job
3594398,HM stated everything is great.  HM stated they really lucked out with this AP.  She is great with HC triplets.  HC and HP love her and AP has bonded really well with HC.  HM has only positive things to say!
3594397,Fernanda still does a great job and they are very happy she wants to stay.  I did once again tell them that this wont be able to happen unless she gets moving on her coursework.  I sent both Fernanda and the host parents an email stressing the importance that she does not procrastinate any longert.
3594361,"HD stated everything is the same.  HD stated AP is a sweet girl but is a little awkward and annoying. HD stated he has more patience with her than HM and if she were not living with them they probably would not have any issues with her.  HD stated there are a lot of issues around the kitchen and food.  AP doesn't really clean up after herself.  HP speak to her about issue and it improves for a few days and then AP goes back to her old ways.  HD stated they are tolerating it until the end of her program year in May and said he doesn't think there are any issues that need to be addressed, but said if anything changed he would let AD know."
3594357,Spoke with Carla. She said Brenda is a hard worker; she probably needs to be more strict with the kids.  She also is not making any friends.   SHe was burned a few times by other APs not calling her back.   SHe has started school but hasn't made any friends there either.   Carla and I talked about the monthly meeting and she hasn't gone to them.  Carla provided reference for Shin family.
3594355,This placement is off to a rocky start.  Lisa feels the AP continues to have some difficutly with her language and is not really taking enough initiative to do things on her own.  Need to follow up in a few days to see where the AP is with getting out and driving and her cell phone.
3594354,All is great with Alina.  Alina's brother from Germany is coming to visit next week.  He will stay with the HF for a week and then the two of them are going to CA together for 10 days.  We also discussed that AP is being very non-committal regarding her education.  HM shared that AP came home from the last outing and told her that she had met an AP that did not complete the requirement and that she simply would not get her completion certificate.  HM is disappointed that AP would not take advantage of the opportunity to study while she is here.  HM and AD will continue to work on AP and see if she might do a weekend class in Chicago like she had talked about over the last few months.
3594348,AD spoke with HM and HM continues to be pleased with AP.  HM's daughter as a little confused a first with why the AP never let at the end of the day but now the HC rests in the fact that the AP doesn't leave every day.  The P ill travel back to NYC in April to pick up her passport.
3594345,Great. AP is with them on a ski vacation in CO.
3594336,"everything great - AP very good with HC and seems happy, seems a little uncomfortable with her english - AD suggested (strongly) the SAY ESL classes - HM will encourage AD"
3594334,AD spoke with HD and HD was very pleased with the AP's performance.  HD said that AP is doing a spectacular job!  HD asked AD if she knew about the AP's recent visit to the doctor for an ear infection.  AD did know about the visit and has spoken with the AP several times about it.
3594329,"Things are going well , Ap will be extending"
3594320,Considering extending with David depending on what he wants to do.
3594317,very brief conversation as HM was at work but all well with AP - HM will call AD back soon to chat longer -
3594294,HM confirmed they have matched with a  new AP from Cultural Care who will overlap with current AP by 3 days. HM plans to take AP to airport for her departing flight.
3594293,"Things are going very well , AP is sick with a stomach bug today but all is going well otherwise. AD Asked mom or referrals directly"
3594283,Good HM says Carina is patient with the boys and has a positive way for discipling the boys.
3594281,"AP fits right in HF no problems with adjustments. HM had questions about vacation and payment, forgot how she did it last time. AD said that AP's have 10 days of paid vacation, HF pays AP for 51 weeks."
3594280,"HM says things are okay.  They are getting geared up for APs departure next month.  HM says they will NOT be getting another AP.  AD did not press the issue, but believes financial situation has changed drastically and they are just trying to maintain stipend to current AP for the remainder of time.  HM says they will no longer need childcare."
3594276,HM says she has traveled to conferences so couldn't talk. AP is doing a great job they like her very much and are very happy with her performance. HF also likes her boyfriend had a great time when he came to visit.
3594275,Good.  HM said al is well.  She cannot believe two years has gone by so fast.  She stll isn't sure if she will get another AP or not.
3594270,Better.  HM reportsthat they had a long conversation where HM voiced her concerns and AP acknowledged and they discussed through ways to improve.
3594266,great
3594263,great
3594259,Good the placement is at the halfway point for the year.
3594258,great
3594256,"HM Jane returned AD's call.  She states that ""everything is great"" with Daniela.  She continues to be a huge help with David.  She said that AP is her ""least socially interested"" au pair, so far, ""but I have to respect that; she isn't sad, she just seems to like being home"".  match is 100% compliant, and there are ""no concerns."""
3594249,"Wendy and Stephen are quite pleased with how things have been since Graziele has arrived.  The month without childcare was tough, but worth the wait for Graziele.  They couldn't be happier at this point and think she is doing a great job with the kids!"
3594248,"HM reports that all is well. No concerns, they are going to NYC in April and are going to try to renew Keyla's passport that will expire next year because they would like to extend with ap. keyla is going to silver bay in March."
3594246,AP and HF are doing well. Sat down again to go over responsibilities etc. They went away last week to FL for the winter break and had  great time.
3594244,"Well, but they are just getting over a yucky stomach bug and all of them got it.  Kara and Bea both go it yesterday but today are better."
3594241,Fine.  HM says the AP just is so reserved and notengaged withher children.  She's just waiting it out until the end of the year.
3594239,"Spoke with HM and she said that Ashley and AP are doing better together and she is trying to help be supportive to AP about not letting AP be bothered by Ashely's autism and ADHD, which can be frustrating at times. HM said AP is doing better not letting it bother her and HM said that anytime AD gets not a behavior problem with Ashley, AP can call HM and she will back up AP and help her diffuse any behavior situation.  Told HM that AD has experience with Autism and can understand the behavior issues even on an autistic child's best day."
3594235,"HM and AP have just begun match.  HM is disappointed about circumstances regarding prior AP's departure, which were apparently far more complicated than we had been told.  That said, HM is optimistic about new AP Giselle, and seems to like her very much, already -- AD's impression is that Giselle is very different in demeanor from prior AP, and that bodes well."
3594233,"Everything is great, HF is very happy with AP, they have few issues with AP English but besides that everything is good."
3594230,"Carol wa doing great and former Carol was still there, so showing her around.  We had snow though so things were not typical.  She seemed happy to be there and was adjusting just fine.  She has lot of friends, the Brazilians and also Lenka in the neighborhood from Czech Republic, with another agency.  Practiced driving until she was comfortable with the minivan, and we have had snow and illnesses, so things are just starting to get normal, but she is adjusting fine.  She is silly in a good way, sweet, loveable, opened up a lot, talks, etc."
3594220,Going well.  She is great with Morgan. She wants to stay with match.
3594218,Diane called back from a work meeting thinking I was someone else.  She only had a sec to talk and stressed all was fine with Aimee.  I was able to just remind her that Aimee does need to still take another class for her 6 month extension to successfully complete the program.
3594205,"Great - we love her - she ""lights up our life"" - her parents were just here visiting and spent most of the time in NYC but a few days with HF and HF LOVED them - so wonderful and energetic - she sees where AP gets her energy and warmth - a great match - REALLY hoping she extends"
3594203,Going very well. Dana has bonded with the children.  HM says that she is a very sweet girl.
3594197,"HM called AD because she is very frustrated with AP.  AP is very focused on taking an intensive ESL class but many of the schools are in the middle of a semester and the classes that are available either don't work with AP's work schedule or the AP is not satisfied with the time commitment.  AP wants to take a class that is 3 hours every day.  AD stated that AP may need to make a compromise. There are courses at the Y in Summit that are 1 hour each day and a free one on Thursday nights which is AP's night off.  AD stated that HM needs to be firm about this.  AD stated AP is in a new country, in a new home with a family she doesn't know well.  It's great that she wants to improve her English but she shouldn't overwhelm herself with commitments.  HM also stated that she allowed AP to go to the cluster meeting during work hours and AP was gone for more than 5 hours.  AP didn't understand that she was supposed to come right back.  AD explained to HM that she should sit down and be very clear about expectations so this doesn't happen again.  HM stated HC is having trouble understanding AP and AP doesn't understand HC.  AD explained this is part of the adjustment period and everyone needs to be patient.  HM stated she might adjust work schedule so AP can attend ESL class on Saturdays.  AD stated if she does this to be clear that this is a one time exception."
3594196,"It is going OK, not great. AP is quiet and does not interact much with the boys. She does not seem to make an effort too much but she is responsible and reliable. They were all away on separate vacations last week."
3594180,"Pretty well.  There are some things that drive her crazy, like not pushing in her chair or picking up crumbs or trash, and drinking all the drinks in the house in two days.  She bought her the special cheese she likes that is expensive and she eats it in two days, but Ronni is not going back to get more before the weekend.  She is going through 24 cans of soda, and 4 six packs of aqua fina grape water that her son drinks, in addition to coffee.  She has started separating ones or Josh since that is all he drinks.  She thinks she has led a priviledged life by all of the very expensive designer things she owns, andthat she wasn't expetced to do things around the house at home.  She said they will never go this young again.  But overall she responds when she is told something and she doesn't really have any issues other than little things.  She is friend's with Katharina who lives in Wilson, so she is trying to et her to meet in the middle places to avoid putting too many miles on the car since her class is in Cary."
3594179,"a quick call but all is good!  no problems at all - AD commented that AP already worried about paying 2014 taxes - HM says A ""Way more organized than me"" no probems"
3594172,"All is well with this HF. Their AP got involved with the match of the Birmingham Byrd family, and the rematch of the AP, but the AD felt it best not to mention this to the HM."
3594171,"great - ap fits in so well - great with HC, family, happy with friends, looking for classes - all great no problems!  hm has a nagging cold but all good"
3594170,"I spoke with Denyce and she is thrilled with Tamryn.  She is good with the kids and loves to explore everything,  She had a great time at the snowtubing event last month and is back there again this weekend.  She is staying with Joe's mom.  NO complaints all is great."
3594167,AP and HF are not extending and had a long conversation about this. AP does not always follow HFs advice on doing charts with children etc but for the most part it is going OK. HF is interviewing with other agencies as well.
3594163,Ali is great and we completed all the extension paperwork and we are good. No complaints and very happy Ali wants to stay with us.
3594160,"Very busy with a new baby but AP is very helpful.  All is well, l nothing different to report."
3594159,HF has been hesitant to call back for monthly contact since they are unsure if AP is the right fit for their family. HM feels personalities are too different.
3594158,"Placement is fine, AP Carolin does her job and does what she needs to do.  The boys are older so its just driving. HM feels AP just does the job."
3594157,"HF just came back from Antigua and had a great break. Andrea is doing well and all set with return ticket. HF is looking overseas but also to extension APs, although it would mean they could not extend. They may wait till August/September if they do not find the right match but are open to matching for May."
3594156,Things are going great with this HF. They are thrilled with Cris and very excited that she is planning to extend. AD told HM she would send the AP the necessary information for extension. They are planning a vacation to Florida for spring break.
3594155,Placement is OK.  Have been working on the daily schedule. AP is very silly and fun.
3594152,AP Liza as always I great with the kids and are transitioning into getting a new AP.
3594150,"Host mom will have to call me back, but Marisol is fine."
3594149,"Placement is going well, AP Minjoo is handling everything fine."
3594147,AP Misaki is great and the kids are going to miss her but for now everything is running smoothly.
3594146,"HM is fine, but thinks about how she will miss the AP. Getting ready for the new AP."
3594145,I spoke with Jennifer and she said they are doing great with Yanni.  SHe is extending and they are very happy. No complaiints.
3594142,"HF is fine.  AP is doing well.  Nothing to report.  When things come up, HF and AP like to handle it themselves."
3594141,"AP is lovely, a joy to have around.  HF very happy to have her."
3594139,"As always AP Talita is great, is great with kids and have no issues to report."
3594137,AP is great and have already started process to extend together.
3594136,"It is going well for the most part. The boys have really connected with her, but the HM is having trouble communicating and AP seems to lack some social graces. AP is responsible and reliable."
3594135,"Good, HD is happy with the AP and everyone is getting along."
3594108,HM reports all is well with Nele. No major issues or concerns. She does her job and is apart of the family. She has been good with schedule changes due to the snow days. Driving is good and she enjoys going to the hockey games with the kids. She has many friends and gets out when not working.
3594099,HM very happy with Paola. She reported that AP sent HM a very nice email telling her how happy she is with her HF and kids and how much she appreciates being an AP and family member in their house. HM forwarded email to AD to read.  HM reported Paola has been very flexible and HM is very flexible with AP (one day she was sick and could not work).  Paola is good about helping with new AP arrivals in their area.
3594094,HM reports all is going well with Petra. She is great with the kids and is doing her best to manage them during the snow days.  We spoke about the return flight process but they may keep Petra on a Student VISA as the kids are older now and they dont' need full time care. But Petra may get married after her AP year so they are not 100% decided yet.
3594093,HM reports all is going well with Aby. She is great with the kids and is doing her best to manage all 4 kids during all the snow days. We spoke about the return flight process a few times and she said her last AP will come back for a visit this summer. They will probably not need another AP but this could change come the new school year in 2014.
3594081,HM reports all is going well with Amel. They are so sad to see  her leave.  They will be moving in Birmingham in a few months.  They are looking forward to Tati arriving.  HM reported that past AP Emilie came back for a visit with her friend and everyone is enjoying the time together.  HM and I discussed Tati's arrival in March and told her another AP will be arriving with her from Mexico.
3594076,"AD did a mediation with AP and both HP's last week. It lasted about 2 1/2 hours.  AD followed up with a Action Plan.  AP is feeling homesick in this cold weather. HF reported that AP has been secretive about her where-abouts and had a strange boy drop her off one morning(Saturday)  when she was suppose to stay overnight at another AP's house. AP feels that she is an adult and does not need to tell the HF where she is going if it is her day off and she doesn't have the car. HF is under the impression that AP has her boyfriend still in Germany so this was concerning to them.  AD had both parties write up 3 things they like/appreciate about each other, 3 things they would like to see changed and 3 things they can do to help make these changes.  The #1 word that came up the most was communication. AP would disappear after work and HF would like for her to be around more. AP feels that being with kids 9 hours per day is long for her and she wants a break. HF agrees with her but would like for her to communicate this with them and not just disappear.  We also discussed/review the curfew which HF would like her and car home by 3:30am or she can sleep out overnight as long as she is honest on where she is going. Both parties appreciated my time in coming out."
3594073,HM reported that AP can't extend for 12 months but they will consider 6 months to get them through the summer.  It was too difficult for the AP to stay for 12 months w/o a 2nd year VISA and it was too expensive for her to get one.  They will start the 6 month ext. process soon.
3594071,HM reported that she has not been very happy with Erika. She said Erika has a Dr. boyfriend now and spends all her free time with him. She said that Erika wants to extend with them but they feel it is only for the boyfriend. HM likes their AP's for 2 years but they don't think they can put up with another year with her.  She reported the kids don't really like her anymore and she is always on her phone and does not keep her room clean. I recommended HM to sit down with her before they even consider extending and review all expectations of a 2nd year if they decide to extend.
3594070,Very well family have just returned from a mini break up to Tampa. Host mom said she does not know how she will manage when ap finishes in the summer she is doing wonderfully.
3594069,Fantastic the girls really love Paula and she is making a wonderful edition to the family. They have just returned from a week in Orlando and had a fantastic time.
3594068,Really well no concerns ap is a member of the family.
3594061,AP continues to be an integral part of their family.  No complaints.
3594059,"AD spoke with HD.  He said they continue to be happy with AP.  She just finished a class.  HF will travel in April and also in July, so they have given AP about 3 weeks off for when they will be out of town.  They are hoping she will extend with them."
3594057,"HF continues to be pleased with Laura.  She is a great addition to their family, and they are thankful to have her.  HF is looking at their schedule to see if they will need an AP for next year."
3594055,"HF plans to extend with Ludo, will break his extension early (in July) and then get a new AP in August.  They will be moving to Las Vegas this summer.  HD will update AD once they have a move date and find a new home there."
3594053,HM said AP is doing fabulous--like always!
3594050,"All is going fine with AP.  Her ankle was bothering her, but HM thinks she is better now."
3594049,"HM continues to be pleased with AP.  She has had to do more work to help get her up to speed with her 3 kids, but still feels her personality is a much better fit than past AP."
3594047,HF continues to be happy with AP.  No concerns.
3594044,"HM will take a trip to California with her son this spring, and AP will not accompany them.  He will have 12 days off.  HM said AP has already used 5.5 days of vacation, and he will use the rest of his vacation during this time."
3594042,All continues to go great with Gigi.  All is on track for her sister to take her place when she goes home.
3594038,All is super.  Entire HF loves AP.  No issues.
3594037,All is going well with Anna.  She loved the APC snow tubing event this month!
3594036,HM called AD back.  She had a few questions about AP ending her year.
3594035,HM got back to AD.  Dasom just registered for spring classes.  She is starting to think about her replacement.  AD sent arrival dates sheet so she can be thinking of that as she is considering her timeline.
3594014,just fine!  HF dropping off AP at the mall for the event.  She's doing just great.  Has appt with DMV to get license this week.
3594013,"Baby arrived!!  Feb 19, a little girl, and the family has come home from the hospital.  Family very happy!"
3593999,HF has some concernes about ap's inability to secure a CA driver Licence. Please read separate note for more info.
3593997,COnducted APO with both parties. Alexander seemed to have bonded with Diana. Rachel seems very happy with ap. She thinks she is the best she has had so far.

3593983,"good.  Shaina went to the doctor from the accident again, and they want her to visit with a surgeon to check the rib again. She is going on Thursday.  Will keep us updated."
3593979,"I spoke with Melissa and she was entering an appointment but said that all is well with Landi, they are doing great."
3593972,"Betsy said things are crazy at work, her boss left and now she is doing 2 jobs and they are doing over the floors in their home which makes life even more hectic. They discussed with Vivi about extending and they are not going to extend."
3593970,I left a voice mail with Bonnie and will try again.
3593958,"Well, no problems or concerns to report. AD mentioned extending with the HF and HM said that AD needed to go back to Colombia and finish college, they will match with a new AP down the road."
3593957,All is well with Martina
3593956,I spoke with HM today. she said that Tamisa left for NJ and they are in the waiting period for their new Ap. I discussed that I will be calling the Friday after her arrival and coming out to meet all directly after and looking forward to meeting the family.
3593955,Great. Family is very happy with Renata and will extend with her.
3593954,I spoke with HF today. she says things seem to have calmed down for all. HF daughter is really trying to get along with new AP and HF feels like AP is trying to loosen up on the idea of rules.
3593953,I spoke with Hm today. she says she is not sure this Ap will work out for her family. she says AP is texting constantly and not focused on the girls. she says her priority is going out and socializing. HM will chat with AP this week and call me next week to update.
3593950,Good nothing new to report
3593947,Ed says all is going well with Maria so far. she seems lovely and the kids are adjusting to a new Ap. I am going over this Thursday night to meet with all

3593944,Jessica continues to express that she is very happy with Juli and all is calm at their house. no issues to report.

3593938,spoke with HM today. she said she found out that AP is sick and not coming to work via Facebook. Hm continues to say she sees AP pushing boundaries. I offered to discuss it but HM wants to handle it in house for now but will update me when she is ready.
3593935,Long conversation with HF today. ongoing issues with AD pushing HF patience around scheduling and time off. AP has been coming home almost every night around 3 am and HF is losing patience. HF will discuss with AP and decide whether or not to mediate.
3593932,Tia is very happy with Hanna and feels very lucky to have located another good au apair.  SHe has a friend down the street who she does a lot with and things are going well.
3593930,"HF has asked AP if she would like to extend with them, they love her."
3593929,"Everything is going really well, Haffa's mom is coming out in a couple of months for some time and hf haven't met her folks yet, so they are looking forward to that.  She's in school Mon and Wed mornings and hm can't remember the name of the school, she was uncomfortable at CSE last year and is much happier here.  HM apologized for taking so long to get back to me, just been busy as usual!"
3593924,Host dad was concerned that some of the au pairs may be working too many hours. He wanted to know our procedures for handling this. I assured him that we check in with the au pairs monthly and ask specific questions regarding this. He says some may be afraid to report this. I informed him that if we suspect this we will check the au pairs schedule and  look into it carefully and that a family could be canceled for this especially if it is a  regular occurence
3593923,HF's house is now on the market and they hope to move at the end of March.  AD thanked the HM for being such a wonderful host to the AP's father while he visited.  AP decided to return home after the contract is over to start her studies.  Things are going well.

She stated that they are well, but there is room for improvement but overall the schedule is back on track.  She stated that Paloma is having some difficulty with the transition of Jose working from home and she has been very clingy to them both.  She hopes that it will even out within the next couple of weeks."
3593892,"HM really likes the suggestion of meeting once a week.  When HM comes in after working all day, she needs some time to decompress prior to having a discussion about the day.  HM wants to hear what is going on, but not as she is trying to transition from work to home life."
3593886,HM says all is well. Natalia is going to stay another year!! She'll finish up her credits at the end of March so they will extend then.

3593851,"Good, thing are going fine."
3593849,HM stated AP is great with the kids but AP doesn't want to be a part of the family and help with the dogs. HM doesn't understand because HM is generous to AP.

3593822,All is great with them.  They had a wonderful time in DisneyWorld.  HM feels that AP really got to see a lot there and had fun.  They have no concerns.

3593818,All is well with the HF and AP.  They are really enjoying being together again.  One concern is that right now Pren does not have a cell phone.  Her Blackberry stopped working and she is waiting for a new iPhone to arrive in the mail.  HM has been nervous to let Pren drive the kids around without a phone.  It should be here and be activated tomorrow.  HF and AP will be going to Mexico next month.  We discussed the automatic visa revalidation for AP's.  Pren will stay as long as she can with the HF.  HM's niece plans to watch the kids over the summer.

3593814,HM is slightly nervous about going to FL with AP.  AP discussed with HF that she is not happy with her hours and does not feel like she is part of the family. AP became very upset when she was speaking and HM was taken back about her feelings.  HD had currently been staying home - not working and the dynamic has changed in the house.

3593804,HM stated that everything is going good. No concerns at all.
3593803,Great.  HM is so happy with AP and with how the program is working for her family.  HM has been recommending the program to her friends and one family has already applied.  HF went on vacation and the AP stayed home and became familiar with the area.
3593800,Sonia left a message for me telling me that things are going well and she has nothing to report.  Getting hold of Sonia for the call back has been difficult so I was happy that she responded.  Prudy says that things are going well but she did not come to the meeting we had on Sunday

3593792,Spoke with Alexa as she had passed along a picture of Tsubasa her previous AP who is married and having a baby so we talked about that great news.  She said everything is great and they cannot wait for some good weather.
3593791,"Very  well, as it has been."
3593786,Very well.  HM has some questions in regards to obtaining a international drivers license for AP. HM does not think the Chinese international license will be accepted in the U.S.  AD sent HM link for international license.  HM is also looking at CT license.  AP is doing very well.
3593779,Great.  AP is having a birthday tomorrow.  Her mom and grandmother are staying for a visit.  HM is very happy to see that AP is developing friendships.  HM is having old AP visit for 2 weeks.  The kids really like AP.
3593777,Great.  HM's son has been traveling the world for crew and just returned back from Argentina.  HF is deciding if they will get another AP for next year or leave the program.  HM would like to see if current AP has any friends that are interested in the program.  HF would like their last year to be positive.
3593760,Well.  HM feels that AP truly wants to do the best that she can do with the family.  HM appreciates her efforts.  HM is looking for another sitter to drive their daughter to her class a few days a week.
3593755,"OK, hmom asked AD to speak to AP about better listening an communicating and AD spoke to Julia at length. Hmom says AP is not following work schedule (late coming back from gym) and other minor issues."

3593750,HF went away last week skiing and AP had some time off as well.
3593745,All is well. AP continues to do a good job. HF and AP stayed here last week but will go away in April. Daughters bat mitzvah was late January and AP took part in all events. HM asked when to start looking for new AP.

3593741,Very well. HF and AP had a nice winter break. No questions or concerns.

3593733,Chris says that things are going well and they are interviewing the pre-match au pair from Spain who is Pablo's friend.  She asked if there was a discount for finding their own au pair. I let her know that APC had the lowest fees for agencies with training in the USA.  She is a great HM and has referred several HF's to me already.
3593731,HM said AP is doing well.  They will all be leaving this Friday for the Caribbean for 2 weeks.  HM asked me to keep a look out for Norwegian AP for mid-late August arrival - if we have one they will most likely renew.
3593730,Spoke with Alison. She had asked me about the extension fee and was happy that ap was extending for 6 months. Alison said she will pick up the extension fee. I advised her that she should submit the extension application online.
3593717,"AD talked to HM who stated that things are fantastic, she described AP as wonderful. She also added that her family adores Michaela. Brittany also told AD that AP parents are coming to visit in May and they will be staying at the same building where the HF lives. Brittany found a studio for them for a good price."
3593714,"HM is extremely happy with how everything is going.  AP is such an important part of the family now so it'd be weird not to have her around.  HD had many questions about extension fees and policies, so AD emailed and addressed all his concerns.  HM also had many positive things to say about our monthly events and how her AP and her friends are always looking forward to it."
3593713,AP is doing great.  HD said she volunteered to go to Erica's volleyball game this evening.
3593710,AP and kids will move to Bethesda the first weekend in March.  HM will visit kids and AP on weekends and will move to area this summer.  AD asked how AP is doing.  HM reports AP is a bit sad but looking forward to the new area
3593700,Marina says that things are going really well. Cibele is enjoying her class even though there is a lot of homework involved.  I told her that Cibele seems much happier now that she can get around with having access to the car.  Marina said that Cibele really enjoyed the meeting in Nashoba for the snow tubing.
3593699,HM is happy that the AP came back from vacation refreshed.  She decided not to extend with the HF in Sugar Land and return home when her contract ends in May.  HM will have a new AP from CC arriving in late Mar.  AD let her know that I'm here for her and that wishes they'd come back to APC.
3593697,Going very well.
3593694,AP is doing alright. Her English is still needing improvement and she will be starting next month at Triton.
3593690,"there are lots of positive things - the child care is good.  But, she had a bad accident and the other car was totaled. It was her fault as she was driving too fast.  She had friends in the car.   Since that, she has watched a lot of TV and is on her phone all of the time.  The kids were out of school last week and there were good things then.   She does a good job with the kids.  Anne is completely wiped out over the accident dn loss of the car. I suggested a very serious talk with Laura."
3593684,HF called. Had gone to SS office with Luisana this am and turned away as didn't have SS letter. I said I would email him generic letter and sorry he had problems.
3593680,HM and I spoke about how to reapply and then we spoke about the selection process. HM as not happy not reaching AP's or being turned down by AP's or not hearing from them.  She asked for help from ME and my help with looking at applications.  HM and I spoke about her requirements and I updated the ME. I also told the HM that she still has plenty of time to find the right person to replace Maria. HM called back and appreciated the advice and liked the selections that the ME gave her.
3593677,"HM said everyone in the house has been sick with strep throat.  She called to get the name of the insurance network for UHC (United Options PPO).  Aside from the sweeping illness in the house, AP is doing fine."

3593665,"HM said that she is very disappointed with AP and HM stated that she has had to speak to AP many times about not completing tasks, but he said that she doesn't seem to be getting through to AP. HM said that AP leaves dirty dishes in the sink, doesn't clean up dirty pull-ups or the potty training potty when HC uses it. HM said that AP also keeps her room very messy. HM said that she and AP have spoken many times, and sometimes AP does better, but then other times she doesn't. AD told HM that we really should schedule a mediation. HM said she would like to talk to AP again and then touch base with AD in a week to see how things are going."
3593662,HM reported that Mariana went back to Mexico for her visit with her family and feels refreshed and is doing a much better job with the kids. HM reported there are still some issues/concerns with the AP's boyfriend and the rules but they are communicating them out.

3593660,"all good, the baby is doing well and they are glad to be back in NY, the children were in AZ for a few days and are back now, all rules are being followed and no questions, will check in again next month"
3593659,"Everything is good. Danila is a very sweet girl and she is a very hard worker. HM does have a concern with her hygiene. It seems Danila often sneezes without covering her mouth/nose even when she is cooking food or cleaning the dishes. The teenage girls have said they will not eat what she cooks because she is not clean enough. HM has talked to her about washing her hands often because it is flu season but this doesn't seem to help. I told HM I would send an email to Danila with hygiene tips and a video about sneezing into your sleeve, etc."
3593653,"all fine with Wyonna, hm does not want to be bothered with my calls and said she told me to call her husband.  I let her know I emailed  him and left a message at his work, and that I need to make these monthly calls... and I asked for  his cell number so I can reach him in the future... she said she guess she could put up with 2 more months of calls and hung up... her ap is done in May.  It seems like she is happy with her ap but not happy that she has to speak with me each month and I doubt she will continue with APC because of that."
3593652,HM said that AP is again not listening to the rules that HF has given her about the car and curfew. HM said that she is going to speak to AP again about this. AD told HM that she really thinks we should schedule a mediation and all sit down and talk. HM said she would talk to AP again and let me know what she thinks.
3593634,HM said things are going well so far.
3593633,HM and I spoke about Jeni leaving Early and new AP coming in July. HM does not remember Jeni asking to leave in June and wanted to find out the rules about this. They understand her ticket is booked already.  I told HM that when Jeni and I spoke about leaving early that Jeni told me that she did tell the HM and asked for her approval and jeni said that it was ok. HM excited about new AP coming but also scared. There won't be an overlap and HM will have to find childcare during the gap.
3593628,"It is okay.  Joanna says they will make it through.  But, she has no common sense.  And she has had three accidents.  One more and she will be dismissed.   She first hit their mailbox and demolished it. The last one , she  hit a car (there was damage) and did not tell Joana for three days.  Joanna is furious. That car is  totaled.  She is going to have a serious talk with Jenifer. She is not careful.   They want this to last until July.  Jenifer did some other dumb things.  Joanna thinks she is loosing her  skill at picking the right person.  She has had very good luck in the past."

HM stated that she thinks AP is a little bit resentful that HF didn't want her to see boyfriend anymore because he was in jail. AD reiterated to HM that AP said she didn't want to be with boyfriend anymore because he wasn't good for her, so she shouldn't be resentful of HF."
3593571,HM and I spoke a couple of times this month. HM still not having a good year with Louise. I tried to set up a mediation a few weeks ago but HM had to cancel it.  HM reported AP is very forgetful and not helpful at all. HM said she does the bare minimum and not much more. HM feels a mediation won't help. I did have a one-on-one with the AP in February and tried to talk to her with steps to step things up with the HF's needs but HM said it helped for a week but that was about it. HM reported that she is very immature and looking for a new AP that can do the job. I recommended to HM to find someone over 21 with the needs they require of an AP.   AD spoke to HM about next AP and how to reapply to start looking. HM wants to let AP leave 1 month early so they can bring in a June arrival as July is too difficult for them. I told HM that she needs to tell AP in advance so she can request her flight home in June with APC and I explained the process for the RFR.
3593567,"Leslie says that things are fine. It was a crazy and busy month with Heemin's sister coming to visit, but they made it work.

3593097,"Everything is well. Their little boy is getting bigger and bigger, Hm said he is too heavy to be carried around. HM wanted to know are they responsible to pay for Clara's classes after she is done with the requirements f they have not spent full $500.

Megan feels she needs a lot of reassurance and isn't used to that b/c Rachel was so confident and able to get everything done with confidence. She hasn't been able to drive much b/c of the weather but they are working on it. Andrea has made a lot of friends and seems happy. She has had some difficulty disciplining Sophia and relies a lot on Nadine (the housekeeper/nanny) or Megan for help. Megan feels she needs to be more assertive and in charge with Sophia.

Adam got a new job in Wilmington, NC which starts August 1 and he wants her to quit working and stay home with the kids.  She isn't sure she will do that and they have to sell the million dollar house in Raleigh to all move.  So they may stay here and stay working until the house sells, in which case she may still need Maria.  But they aren't sure about any of it yet.  Heather is still working the night shift."

I reminded them all of the importance of this point.
3592866,HM is still very pleased with her AP- used the words staus quo. the 3 year old is in daycare now so her has beend getting sick and bringing it home but otherwise they are very well
3592848,The Hf is doing well and the children are well cared for by Meme.   Hm continues to promote to HD to accept Meme for who she is and what is is capable of and to let the rest go.  There haven't been any real issues this month.  Luke states that Meme is the best au pair ever and he really wants her to stay longer.  Mary thinks that the transition to whatever they decide will be ok. The girls have been involved in competitive gymnastics so they have ben busy on weekdays and weekends. Mary will be out of town this coming weekend and Meme and Jim will be at home.  Meme has a friend coming to visit next week and she will be staying with them.
3592841,"Met with HF. Everything is going well so far.  Claire is doing well with the baby, already able to get her down for a nap.  They are not able to get Claire on car insurance until she has CA License.  Gave info on how to obtain that."
3592835,great
3592832,AD has spoken to HM and HD several times this month.  They have been having major issues with Shino and they were about to ask for a rematch but thought they would give it another try. I told HM that I would go to their house another time to talk with her. HM reported that AP reported to them that she likes to play with kids but does not like to clean up or thinks it her job.  AP rearranged furniture to play with the kids but didnt' want to put it back. AP feels emptying the dishwasher should not only be done by her as the HP's use the dishes also.  AP also reported that she does not like it when the HD talks to her with the rules of her job of keeping up the house and picking up after the kids and she got mad at him when he left papers out on a Saturday when he was watching the kids.   AD has noted everything in Casper and spoke to AP several times.  HM is traveling a little and has a 2nd job teaching at nights so she is very busy.  HM reported that kids missed the bus because the AP didnt' start the car to drive them to the bus stop so the AP thought maybe there was no school and did not take the kids to school.
3592821,"Doing well.  I talked to her the Friday before she had the baby, as I made a note to call before the due date.  She was running aroun to Dr appointments, etc. but said they were doing great.  She said she would call back for a better conversation but ended up having the baby the next Sunday.  She sent me an email follow up saying that Kat was great with Felix and it has been good for her to know him before the baby arrived.  The baby's name is Annika and she was born on Sunday the 9th."
3592819,Everything currently is going well.  AP is scheduled to leave this HF next week.  HF said that they have a few AP the they are interested in and will continue to interview.
3592815,"call back from Monica, things are going well, the children are good and things are going smoothly with Judy, she is doing a good job and fits in well with the family, no questions and all rules are being followed"
3592812,HM stated everything is going well but she sounded very irritated.  HM stated they just returned from vacation.  AP took personal vacation at same time but her flight was cancelled today so one of the HP had to stay home with HC. HM stated she was upset that they had to miss work because of APs cancelled flight but said AP called when she was getting on plane and should be arriving in Newark tonight.
3592811,Things are much better
3592806,"all good, settling into new home, children are getting  used to it, things are good with Lan, no questions and all rules are being followed, will check in again next month"
3592805,"good, no problems.  AP is doing a great job."
3592799,HM reported all is well with Genny. HM  has no issues or concerns that needs my help. HM did say there are times that she feels the kids rule the house over Genny but she has found this with past AP's. HM wanted to make sure this gets better before the summer arrives.
3592793,HM stated everything is generally fine.  HM stated they have had a few minor misunderstandings but nothing they couldn't work through and stated that AP is great at arts and crafts and helping HC with homework.  HM stated that AP mentioned she has to pay $600 in taxes and HM asked AD to look into that because it seemed like a lot considering what she is earning.
3592791,"got my message, all good, glad the extension went through, will call if they need anything, were away for a few days over the weekend"
3592786,"Malia is well.  She is not feeling well for the past week, so it has been slow moving through her work and Avery is sick as well.  She asked if Alex needed to pay taxes and I responded that we recommend that she does and reminded her that all of the information was sent to both of their emails."
3592783,HM reported Patti has stepped it up a little but HM still has many concerns with her shyness and how quiet she is.  I told HM that this will take some time. HM wanted to find a private tutor for Patti to take ESL classes until she can get into a class at OCC. HF was taking her on a cruise this week for 7 days. I told HM that I would call Patti and offer some advice on what to do and what not to do. We also did some role playing with when she sees the baby crying during dinner or when the older girls want to go on the waterside. I told AP that she needs to jump and offer to do things with the older girls and don't wait for them to ask her.   AP reported she will do her best and get back to me when she returns this week.
3592781,"HM thought it was going well, but found out Friday the AP is unhappy and leaving the program."
3592777,great-we are very happy with Ginna and she is getting enrolled in classes and just doing so well.
3592767,I said good-bye to the HM and AP this month. Told HM that she was always welcome back to the APC program if her childcare needs have changed.  AP was staying with boyfriend. Last AP is back in the USA to get married.  HM thanked me also for my support over the years and I wished her well.
3592763,spoke to HM and all is good
3592761,"It's ok, there are days when she's fully engaged and days when she's just not there.  HM is ready for it to be over.  They do not want to look at this time, maybe if they have trouble they'll restart or will do a summer au pair if they can find an icap, advised I will call her in a month or so to check in to see how things are going."
3592750,Hm contacted AD this month complaining that AP was pulled over in the family car for speeding but AP did not think it was for her so she didn't stop so she kept driving.  HM reported that AP was arrested for failing to stop but then they let her go after looking at her documents.  AP did not inform HF and HF found out because the AP received tickets in the mail. HM now limited the driving and the car usage and counting the days until the Ap leaves.  HM tried to explain the the AP that with her and her husband's connections in the courts that they could have helped her with all this and could have had it removed without any fines but since HF feels AP is too stubborn she didn't ask but HM upset that they were not made aware as the AP had the family car.  HM asked me not to talk to the AP about this.  HM is on hold for now for looking at a new Ap for June.
3592748,"Everything is fine, just humming along."
3592739,"congrats on new baby boy@  commented on size, over 9 lbs and had a c section luckily, all good, settling into a routine, Charline is doing great..."
3592738,Everything is going well.
3592735,Really well. The babies have arrived ad they are busy caring for them.  One now weighs 4 lbs. 11 oz and the other is 5 lbs 1 oz.  They just eat and sleep.  Her Mom is there to help and Diana is doing really well at keeping their son busy.  All is well.
3592733,HM stated that all is going well with Becky. AP has been good entertaining the boys while they are home with the amount of school closings due to the weather. HF will await the arrival of their new AP and will have family assist in the transition break.
3592731,"all good, Rayssa is a pleasure, no questions, told me all about their vacation last week in Canada and a stop over in Niagra Falls... sounds like fun!"
3592717,"HM and HD stated that all is going very well with Kate. Kiera has really bonded with her, spending time hanging out in her room. Kate has a great personality and fits in nicely."
3592716,Everything is great.  They are going to extend with Anne.  She has found enough class hours to complete the requirement so she can complete the application  to extend on time.    Felicia wants to send in her application now along with the payment.
3592715,Emmy and Ruby were in Las Vegas for a girls weekend and really enjoying themselves.  She stated that they were going to ask Coco to stay for 6 more months.  I explained to her that he needed to finish all of his coursework by March 30 or he would not be allowed to extend.  I explained to her the options that I gave him and also that I was disappointed that it was going to cost him so much since he waited till the last minute.
3592706,Spoke briefly to HM she was in a meeting. Clara is doing great. They couldn't be happier
3592696,"Monica was overjoyed with the transition and with Jules ideas and work ethic.  They seem to be getting along very well and with an ease as well.  George will also be working closer to home and will no longer be traveling on a weekly basis and working far from home.  Monica feels that the children are so happy for both of the changes.  She did mention that the girls asked about Sam, so they skyped with her to say hello."
3592693,"things are going very well, Angel is very sweet and the family likes her a lot, she is nurturing and very helpful"
3592690,AP is very happy with HF.  AP said family got snowed in for a few days with the last snowstorm.  AP hopes to attend the next social in March
3592687,"Things are going very well, no questions. o news on the move out of country"
3592683,"AD spoke with HM on 2/22. All is going well with Lais. She will not be continuing in and extension, so HF asked about matching timeframe and protocol. HF had a nice time skiing in VT earlier this month, and Lais took a few lessons and really liked the sport and would like to pursue it again this winter."
3592680,"HM stated everything is fine. No complaints or concerns at this time. HM stated they would be starting all over again once the new AP arrives in April but she understands it's important and it's DOS regulations.  HM asked if there is anything they need to do for the new AP before she arrives.  AD explained nothing needs to be done with AD and HM, but there are things they can do at home to prepare."
3592678,Tim called as I had left a vm for him.  He said that things are great and that Michelle has done a lot of things with their family and enjoys being included in their activities.  I told him that she I very happy and told me that she really enjoys being with the family and has some friends too.  She is doing the BAE class and is enjoying that
3592675,"I spoke with Anne who stated that all was well.  She did say that Anne seems to be doing great, she enjoyed her brother's visit, is enjoying her coursework and has been driving the children to and from school and activities.  This is working out very well and they no longer need to have another person that they are paying to drive. She did also acknowledge that Anne has made some friends and seems to be content with that.  They are traveling to Charleston together for her mother's birthday in March and Anne will miss the meeting.  HM stated that they were looking into other agencies for their next AP. I asked if there was anything that we could do to help her feel more comfortable with her decision to stay with us.  She said there wasn't anything""wrong"", but that they were.  I suggested that she stay very keen to hidden fees and interviewing strategies form other companies and reminded her of our appreciation for their participation in our program."
3592668,"HD Chris returned AD's call.  Said that things were ""stellar!"" with Dri, and that they ""can't imagine how we could do this without her"".  Driving may not happen, as she just can't seem to do it... BUT it is not a problem for them. They are already working up to asking her to extend for a second year, and they really hope she will!"
3592667,Very well!  They are thrilled that Angie has decided to extend with them.  I explained the process to Richard and said I would send them the FAQs.  We talked about the car and Angie's driving. She is  good driver after all.  She just needed practice.  Driving in Colombia is a lot different.  The car is repaired and all is well.  Angie has a lot of friends and is happy here.  Having her brother here recently helped her decide to stay for another year.
3592660,"I spoke with Ken who stated that the family, minus Joanna were in Mexico.  They were having a great time and were heading back.  He stated that all is well and Joanna continues to do a great job with the children."
3592652,AD spoke with HM Cara on 2/17. All is going wonderfully with Karina. She has been doing a great job despite the weather this winter. AP will attempt to experience skiing later this month.AP's classes are good and they have spoken with the current instructor for advice on a future class. HF's friend/referral Louvie may be matching soon.
3592650,"The HF is well, but struggling without Ann.  They have decided to not get another au pair right now and to wait it out with the help of part time help.  They do not feel that it would be easy for Neung and another au pair to work so seamlessly together.  I assured him that it can be done and he could interview just to see if there is such a candidate.  He stated that they will do this until the girls are old enough to go to daycare a couple of days a week and that will help."
3592642,Everything is great. HF is happy to have AP back.
3592637,"Hf is doing great.  They are settling the land next week for their new home in Indiana.  They are hoping to be moved in by late July so that they boys have a short transition in the new home.  They currently have their home on the market.  They have begun working with Ginny for a new AP.  Alina is doing well and the boys respond very well to her and enjoy having her here.  The ban on visitors has been lifted and they were able to ""patch the wine incident damage from the New Year""."
3592635,"All is well with Janaina she is good with the children and very mature. Her driving needs to improve a little, but the hM had a driving  instructor take her for a few hours"
3592633,Everything is great.  Natali got her driver's license so she is tootling around on the weekend now and very happy.  they are going to Hawaii next weekend (march 1) for a week and taking her along.   They really enjoy her company and having her as a member of the family.  It had made a big difference in their lives.
3592625,"Reina and Zev feel that Ona is unhappy and not enjoying her work with the children.  They have asked her, but she insists that she is fine.  They are concerned and would like for me to speak with them.  They have admitted that Violet has been very challenging and continues to do so.  She does not respond to any consequences except taking away her American Girl Doll and the fallout is horrible so they choose not to do that.  We spoke about Reina's lack of ""enthusiasm"" and how it is ok for her as the parent to feel that way, but not the au pair.  They would like to discuss if this placement is right for Ona."
3592620,"HM Laurie reports that all continues to be great with Ilona. She is always happy, but just a bit concerned about the tax paying process. AP was out with friends who are visiting from Europe. AP is enjoying her class."
3592618,Nao is doing well. She is great with the kids and the HF couldn't be happier.
3592616,"Connected with Tracey who is really happy. tracey says that Mariana is totally different and much more excited to be here and to be with them, they have had a really good time together so far. We are setting up a time for the arrival orientation this week too, so we will see each other and catch up on everything real soon."
3592610,Called HD back. He said all is great. Andressa is a good au pair with great driving skills. Has made some friends but none she has connected with that well.
3592608,"AD spoke with HD John on 2/23. HF and AP still need to meet to discuss how it is going, and how they will count time off that has occurred recently, coupled with the upcoming vacation. HF just returned from a ski trip to Canada, while AP remained in NY with family."
3592604,"HF is wonderful.  They were skiing in Michigan with the family and the children have been having lessons and skiing with their parents as well.  Delphine stayed behind in Chicago because she had some things to do.  Delphine has been driving, this is the first au pair to ever drive in this placement.  They trust her and have had her insured.  It was very inexpensive, $100 for the year."
3592603,Everything is going fine. Will need to begin the process to search for a new au pair in a few months.
3592591,HM says that everything is still going well. She says that AP is planning on extending for 12 months which they are very excited about.
3592589,"Gemma is doing well. The kids like her and she is adjusting well. The kids have all been sick and it has been challenging, but she is a good sport"
3592585,AD spoke with HF on 2/15. Katerina is doing well and the boys are bonding nicely with her. AP is happy and has connected with other girls from APC and family friends. HF only concern is that AP does get out and enjoy activity during her off time. AP will try to get to the Feb monthly event. If possible carpooling would be helpful. AD will follow-up.
3592579,"HM Deanna said that things are ""good"" with AP Marian.  She and HC have a ""great relationship,"" and the fact that things have gotten a little awkward since they decided not to extend with her, that it isn't really problematic.  Match is compliant."
3592576,Good. AP is learning along side of HM who is still home with baby.
3592573,AD spoke with both HM and AP. All going well so far. The older twins have been with HM's parents for the arrival. AP is being trained by nanny Jessica and learning. HM said that she has some issues we will address during the AO. AP stated that she learned so much at training and met new friends and looking to meeting for the AO on 2/26. HF will be having the children's birthday party Sunday and AD advised AP to learn and assist over the weekend.
3592572,"HF is moving to Washington DC in three days. I asked HM Lori to send me their new home address and contact info. I did not tell them that Gui had some concerned about their move and living space in Washington because he wants to talk with them first, HM Loti said that Gui has decided to move with them"
3592566,Really great !  Carol is a very busy girl and has gone to church on Sunday.  They have matched with a new au pair from Brazil and are very happy about that.  Kelley asked about keeping in touch with new AP until she  arrives.  I gave her some ideas.
3592548,"AP is doing OK. She went to SF with them this past weekend, which was nice. AP's room is a big mess; HM is debating about asking her to clean it up."
3592541,Called to catch up and se how everything is going. They are very busy and have just been away for a vacation with the family in Mexico and Axel stayed home. Everyone is doing well.
3592534,AD was just informed this month that HF was moving to Florida through the AP.  I told HM how to submit the HF ext. application and that I would see the AP at the AP monthly event and would fax the AP ext. application. HM thanked me for my help. HF will move sometime in June and will provide address when she gets it.
3592533,Called HM first thing as there was a message from her at 1am this morning that I couldn't hear. HF said must have dialled accidentally. Were on red eye back from Hawaii. All things good with Fanny and with travelling. Don't think she will extend.
3592532,Annika is doing better. The weekly meeting have helped a lot. The feedback from her and being able to give to her has been great. She is much better with the boys
3592524,Everything is going great.  HM Kristin is very happy with AP Tati.  She really likes that the AP has her own life and does her own thing on the weekend.  She has a lot of friends and is very different from their previous AP who was always unhappy.
3592511,"All is good with ap, hf is disappointed ap is not extending,but they understand. Hf will possibly be moving over next few months."
3592507,"Brandy said ""excellent."""
3592502,"HM said, ""Well, it is always something"".  HF had a talk with AP awhile back telling her that they didn't want her taking all the kids to the beach or pool for safety reasons.  Last weekend AP and Grandpa were home with the kids while HP were away and when they got home the kids ran to HM very excited to tell her that AP had taken them to the beach.  HM did not bring this up with AP as she is just tired of always having some type of issues going on with AP and when HM does talk to her about things, she is in a bad mood for the next 24 hours.    HF would love to be able to end this match early and find a new AP, but they are afraid to take of chance of going without childcare coverage during the transition time.  HF thinks about ending the match early all the time, as things have not been good from the beginning.  Just not a right fit.  HM and AD will talk again in a couple of weeks and go from there."
3592501,"all is well, ap continues to be great with kids. Ap will be going on vacation soon, and is planning a weekend course at silver bay"
3592499,HF contacted AD this month asking if AP's were responsible for paying for the damage of the tire after hitting a pot hole. I told HF that she was not responsible for the tire but if there was damage to the car. HD reported no damage to the car.  HD reported that AP did try to call him for help but HD did not have his phone with him. AP and friend changed the tire and drove home. HD reported the cost is about $300 and upset why an AP is not responsible to pay this or help pay for it. Hm sent email to AD with how upset she was.  HF was with different agency for many years and feels that agency would make the AP pay.
3592494,Spoke with Ellen and she said that they had a good time Skiing last week over the school vacation.  She said that Maria is great and they are really enjoying having her.  She will be going to another Mass Bay course soon.
3592490,Everything is fine. Katie is lovely and they are relally enjoying her. She was away with them last week on vacation
3592486,"HM Alysa said that AP Magaly is ""truly lovely"" and that they are ""having a really great match"" together.  There are ""no concerns at all"" and HM confirmed that match is compliant."
3592484,HM feels the match is not going well and that every day brings another struggle. Personalities are too different. Not sure yet what she wants to do.
3592483,"AD spoke with Michele and discussed mostly about Rosie's continuing in the program for an extension, or her return. AD reviewed dates and matching timeline, including Early Match and returning host family bonus. HF feels that AP must make a decision by March 1st to give HF enough time to follow-up on their program year 2. All else is great with the childcare of the twins."
3592476,"HD contacted AD Sat. morning at 7:30am. AD emailed HD on Sunday evening acknowledging the message but since it was the weekend I would all him on Monday. HD called AD at 10:30 telling everything what happened on his side.  HD reported that AD sent Text messages to HD Sat. morning at 4:20am saying that she couldn't work on Sat. morning because she was not feeling well from having her Wisdom teeth pulled and her medication was making her impaired. HD reported to AD that AP drove a friend to the airport in his car at 5:00am so HD was upset how she could drive a friend but not work and take kids to Sat. morning activities.  HD was upset and swore at the AP and said he will not apologize.  AP and HD exchange several words and ended into an argument.  AP had Sunday off and AP sent email to HD.  HD did forward the email to the AD for her files.  HD also complained that AP is lazy, house is a mess and she always has friends over without asking. I reminded HD they have 3 months left and they need to do their best to pull it together and work things out. I offered to call the AP and talk with her.  I also told HD that AP sent me and email this week that she got her Wisdom Teeth pulled and that the HF has been amazing with her. AP also offered to take vacation days during these days."
3592467,"HM Stephanie said that everything is great with AP Maria.  They have listed their house, as they would like to get a place in Howard Co. with a yard; AP is ""very flexible and sees it as an adventure"" regarding whether or not it will see while AP is still here.  Match compliant."
3592462,HM said that all is going quite well with Radka. It is an easy transition as they do know each other from Radka's previous NJ match. Kyle has a nice relationship with AP and no concerns. She genuinely seems to want to participate as a family member. Even the cat has taken a liking to her.
3592460,HM says that they are all doing great and have no concerns.
3592447,"HM Lynne was getting ready to go into a meeting; confirmed that things were going well with AP Henny, and that they are also still looking forward to AP Sheila's arrival.  Match compliant."
3592444,"Nella is doing a great job. The HF will miss her. HM is prematching with a Spanish AP and is a little nervous, but also excited"
3592439,"AD spoke with HM, she is doing well and forgot speaking to AD last month. HM had some tax questions. AD directed her to the accountant. HM request a paid receipt for the program fees. HM says ap is doing well, she is nice and helpful. They are happy with her. HM was a little concerned about AP, not getting her NJ dl, and said she knew the ap did not pass the test, but she was unsure if she retook it. AD inquired about the ap and hm communication, HM says communication is good, but hm doesn't want to ask her questions or micro manage her. HM would like me to ask ap, but not to mention hm's request."
3592435,"HD Scott returned the monthly request. All is going very well with Nicky. She is very good and patient with the children, and her driving confidence has improved. AP is meeting new friends and is happy."
3592430,"HM Gillian said that ""things are good will Jacque; we have had no problems, she seems happy, and things really are going well.""  Match compliant."
3592428,"AD spoke with HM Denise. Shez provides very good childcare and her family really likes her. AP is seeking to enroll in her education in the coming weeks at BMCC. HF feels that driving needs to be improved with more practice, but due to the weather it is difficult to get out safely.  AP enjoyed meeting others in both clusters during the recent event."
3592418,"AD spoke with HM Beth on 2/24. Katie is set to depart next month. It has been a dynamic year, and the HF will not be continuing in the program. The children are growing and they will benefit from being in pre-school and having family assist in the childcare."
3592410,HM returned AD call and apologized for not getting back to me sooner. AD let her know that was fine but I wanted to make sure we spoke and that everything was going well. HM said things are good and we talked about AP plans to travel to Columbia and that she was wanting to get a new visa during that visit for her extension time.
3592381,"This is a brand new placement, so most of the questions are premature. The host parents have voiced that the language barrier has been challenging, but they feel it is already getting better. The HM said she wasn’t sure that their daughter was bonding as quickly as they had hoped, but she knew it would take some time. The HD drove the AP to the event last week."
3592379,AP just arrived and the APO is scheduled for 3/6.  HM happy that AP was able to come to the meeting on Sunday. They will train this week and show her around and maybe take her driving.  I told HM to take 1 day at a time and ease her way into showing her everything and don't overwhelm her the 1st week.
3592374,HM is so appreciative of the AP and they're getting along just fine.  AP has made a few friends and is going out more on the weekends.  AP is also starting to practice driving on the local roads.  AD and HM also discussed the possibility of the HF moving back to NJ.  They plan to put the house on the market in July and also spoke to the AP about this and let her know that she may decide to move with them or try to rematch with a local HF to stay in Houston.
3592372,"AD has been in contact with this HM on several occasions this month. She sought advice about their next placement. She also inquired about traveling with the AP beyond her year, and if we could work with them on their flight. Alita is doing well, and the HM has been very pleased with her. She said they just “get” each other. She will be really sad to see her go."
3592361,no problems. Baby is really good. It's an adjustment having 2. Pui has been very helpful. HM asked about timing for starting search for new AP. AD told her about early match discount and suggested she start early.
3592346,"Everything is going great, she is a wonderful au pair and they love her.  She's switching her visa to a student one and HM's mom is sponsoring her to do that.  They really don't need full time help anymore so they won't be renewing, but it's good to know their app is good for a year."
3592345,Everything is great. Trying to not get too sad about Selma leaving. Current AP will overlap for a week and train new AP
3592334,HM reported all is well with Ilayda. Happy to hear that a new AP arrived to her area and sad that Ilayda's best friend is moving to Florida. They are very happy with her in the 2nd year and have no issues.
3592331,"Everything is going well. AP and HM discussed area activities for children.  HM sts they are considering looking for another AP but since this AP has been with them for 2 years they may take a break of a few months between APs.  They found last time they had someone that knew them so well that the HC had a harder time adjusting to a new AP.  Between family members, summer camps, and HF vacation they may not get another AP until August or September. AD encouraged them to go ahead and reapply as there are already APs that are coming up with the first availability being later in the summer, including August."
3592329,"HF is doing well.  Caught them at a bad time this weekend, and did not ask about their moving plans.  AP had mentioned a possible move at our meeting this month, but neither Host parent has mentioned it to me yet."
3592328,HM reported that Elissa is doing well. They will probably not continue with the AP program when she leaves.  Elissa will go back to Mexico and may come back later this summer for a visit. Hm and I spoke about the AP return flight process for a few minutes.
3592325,HM is very happy with how much AP cares for boys and how attentive and creative she is with the arts.
3592318,HD is very pleased with Hana and how much a part of the family she has become.
3592314,"HD says things are going great.  AP was not able to make it to our bowling meeting this month, but hopeful about next month's mtg."
3592308,HM says things are going well.  No problems or issues to discuss.
3592307,"Spoke with Joel - Dawn was sick with a 24 hour bug.  He says they will be sad to see Laura leave as she is so good with the kids, but they are looking forward to Moa arriving in March"
3592300,Spoke with Jake - they are getting busy with the enrollement for the summer camp.  Verena is doing a good job and is very happy with the camp and the other counselor friends that she has made.  We joked about her coming back as a counselor in the future.
3592296,HM reported all is well with Opal. Her English is improving and she has made many new friends. She is good with the boys. She is taking an ESL class before she gets into the College which has really helped. HM said her driving is very good now and she drives the boys every day even in the snow and ice.
3592295,HM called me back. Apologized been very busy. Said things with Jacki are okay. Still not wild about personality as finds her a little cold at times but generally okay. Not sure what shes doing when Jacki leaves.
3592291,Sue says that things are going well - they were up in Vermont for a few days skiing and had a great time.  Bill is working a lot and traveling long stretches at a time so that is hard  No au pair needed after Clara as Sue will not be working.
3592284,HF reports all is well and happy that lauren has agreed to stay for 1 year with them.  She will go back to SA in March for her vacation. The kids adore her and she is apart of their family.  HM reported there has been some issues between the AP and the HD and they seem to communicate them out.
3592280,AD has been in contact with HM a few times this month.  HM was very concerned about getting AP into an ESL class of some sort.  They will be going to the Fremont Library in Mundelein.  There are classes there on Tues/Thurs mornings.  AP will be able to meet another AP Marcella there as well.  AP is doing great.  HM says her English is already improving a ton -they no longer use a translator app to help converse!  AP is also driving a bit and starting to get comfortable with that.  AP has been very sick almost since her arrival.  HM is a nurse and says it is viral and just needs to pass.  AP did not come to the outing last week because she was feeling so bad.
3592259,All is good so far.  See also Welcome Call note.  AP's English is very good.  HM was concerned about her being able to meet other AP's in the area.  Mayara has already been in contact with a few of them - so that is great.  APO to be scheduled for next week.
3592250,"Per HM Krista, ""Everything is great with Mari!""  Confirmed match is compliant; she is eager to find next AP, so that matter is settled.  HM asked if there is a way for her to search for specific APs by their number, without having to look at the entire list of APs (Mari has spoken with some girls who will be looking for their extension year), so she can look at their profiles and request interviews.  AD said she would double check on that and get back via email asap."
3592243,"All is good with them.  She is VERY sad that Busra did not extend with them.  HM is nervous about the new AP arriving and having to train her and wonder if she will develop the same rapport that Busra has with Jacob.  We discussed that the new AP has been talking with Jacob and Busra to start developing a bond.  We discussed that kids are very loving and generally receptive to change - that it just may take a few weeks or so to adjust.  HM is nervous, but optimistic.  We also discussed that HM has learned a lot from the 2 experiences she has - and each time it gets easier."
3592241,"I spoke with David and he said he and and Kelsie are feeling very insecure about trusting Adriana with the kids as the schedules escalate and question whether  she would be responsible to driving them around the area for their activities.  She is simply not really focused on them and it is clear it is all about her social life and what she wants to do here.  Ap  is described as quite self absorbed and unaware of her impact on the family  with her lack of being able to view the perspective of anyone but herself. EX.  Adrianan came to the host family three weeks right before she wanted to go to Costa Rica with a friend from Tennessee.  HF has worked it out but she was not remorseful or apoligetic. In general HD says ap thinks the "" universe revolves around her ""   HF has spoken  with her and if they do not see a big  improvement then they will request a rematch.  AD informed them of their timeline and discussed  the transition process.  Will send the transition guidelines to HD"
3592231,Very good
3592224,"HM called AD back.  She is very frustrated that AP did not want to extend with her family afterall, b/c she wants to live closer to her friends in Silver Spring.  She said AP listed her top 3 reasons for coming to the U.S., and none of them included childcare.  HM said she will end being in APC program, and will seek other childcare."
3592223,Things are going well for HM and AP is doing great in her extension time. HM requested a new copy of her invoice and our tax id information. AD sent that information to her and followed up to make certain she had and the information she needed.
3592220,All is good. They are finding it very hard to believe that Dulce will be leaving them soon.  They are making sure to have get togethers with friends and family so they can all say goodbye to her.  Brian plans to be at home after Dulce leaves to take care of their son.  He also will focus 100% on writing so that he can work from home full time.  They will not continue with the program
3592214,"HM Angela ""can't believe how lucky we are to have Luisa!  She's a regular Mary Poppins!""  She is more independent, now, with classes and driving and making friends, and she is ""amazing!"" with HC Mason.  Things are going great with new baby Presley, and match is happy and compliant.  HM and AP still have weekly meetings, and intend to continue with them."
3592207,"Well.  Kathryn is doing a good job.  Amy thinks things are going smoothly.  I did not tell her about Kathryn's problem with her tooth because she didn't want me to.  I'm trying to help her find a cheap dentist.  HM said she was in the process of interviewing and very close to matching.  I see that the HF has now matched with Marketa.  HM said Kathryn has made some new friends because two of her good friends have left now.  She continues to help Petra adjust to her job and family, which I really appreciate."
3592206,"All is good with them.  They are busy - as always.  HM contacted AD regarding Edith's visa.  Edith is planning to go to Puerto Rico next month.  HM wanted to know if there would be any concerns with her visa.  As Puerto Rico is a US territory, AD explained that all would be well."
3592198,"AP has just arrived, but so far things are going well.  AP Michelle has same birthday as HC Michelle, and they all think that is pretty neat.  APO scheduled for Thursday, 2/27 @ 9am."
3592192,very good-HM told me that Mario is dating AP Sandra from our agency.
3592187,very good-HM wish for AP to extend but AP decided return to school.
3592186,"HM Anne returned AD's call.  ""All is well with us!""  HF and AP remain happy together and have a ""great routine"" in place.  Match confirmed to be compliant."
3592182,great love hf and hc - just back from weekend in montreal (why she missed 2/2 cluster meeting) and now on her way to a weekend in DE - had reached out on FB to find travel companions and is going with an AP from LI - got together with Wiktoria and Sabine - going around to Starbucks meetings - went to NYC to Met - all great
3592181,"Spoke to HD things are going great, The HF is not looking forward to the transition but HD is positive abou it."
3592178,Things are going well.  HD said it was time for him to get started on search for next AP and will do application.  Likes younger candidates as he feels older candidates are unemployed for a reason.
3592174,very good-HM will ask AP today for extension.
3592168,very good-HM will look for new AP very soon.
3592163,"things are going very well, HF was in PR and and was sorry not getting back to Ad. App is going great, HM was short because she was running into a meeting."
3592160,very good-AP is going to visit her family in March.
3592159,HM stated everything is great.  HM was home because they just got back from vacation in Mexico.  AP traveled with them. HF is very happy with AP. HC loves AP very much.  HM stated they would be happy to extend with AP if she was interested.  HM stated she had not discussed with AP yet but would talk to her.  AD stated I would bring it up during our March MC.  AD gave HM extension pricing and deadlines.
3592156,"Charlotte's last day of work is Friday and her final week of pay and then she flies back to Sweden on Tuesday. She thanked me for everything over the past year. Does not need another AP at this time.  She said ""if I return to work full time we will give you a call.  Not on our next year agenda but once my high schooler graduates, she will be a senior next year, it is a possibility and Aupair care is a great agency so we'd be sure to give you a call. ""....!!!!"
3592154,Excellent!  Very happy with everything.
3592148,very good-HF told me that AP have friends Vivi for a weekend.
3592139,"Spoke to host mother she is very happy with our service and to have AP in her house. AP is quite but very good with baby. AP have a lot friends from our agency,"
3592126,very good-I spoke to HM she LOVE her AP.
3592120,very good-AP apply to school in Germany and he was accepted. AP will not extend with in US. HF will look for new AP arrival.
3592118,Great - love AP - she's very quiet and shy so often hard to read her but she's a great balance of part of the family but busy and active social life
3592110,AP and HF continue to do well. They all enjoyed the nice weather over the weekend. AP is sad her good friend Rebeca is leaving in May and AD will keep that in mind. HC is starting KG in fall.
3592103,HD stated everything is going as good as can be expected. HF and HC are really happy with AP. No complaints or concerns at this time.
3592096,Good. AP has finally been able to get to the class she wanted. AP has friends outside of the APC community and AP seems very happy. She is quiet but it just seems to be her personality
3592090,"Things are going well, They are excited for the new AP to arrive but will deeply miss Marie, the AP has become such apart of the HF. It is going to be really hard to say goodbye"
3592079,well. Hmom traveling a lot and has been very busy.
3592053,"Dulce just arrived so the following are N/A. AD is concerned already regarding this match as detailed in the welcome call notes. The HFO will be scheduled for this week, so the AD is planning to take a copy of the HFA and highlight the areas of particular concern."
3592039,Very well. HF went on vacation to Mexico and AP went to Florida.
3592021,"Everything is going great. They love Jeressy. HM has been busy at work with the Michael Dunn trial, and she was in NYC last week. She says that Jeressy wishes to extend with them for another year!"
3592015,Very well  HF went skiing and had a great time.
3592014,"AD spoke with HM Christine on 2/16. HM and AP had been ice skating enjoying the winter recently.  Priscilia is doing well and considering extending with the HF. AD reviewed with HM that AP cannot return home without a valid visa in year 2. AD had spoken with AP regarding this, and AP indicated that she wanted to visit during the holidays. AD relayed that this would not work unless the extension went through early and then AP took a trip this spring to renew the visa and returned before May. HM said that she would discuss with AP and move forward with that knowledge."
3592013,"AD spoke with HD Jim on 2/16. Everything is awesome with Kate. She is very helpful and flexible with Marie traveling recently. AP goes to NYC often with friends, as well as participates in family activity. HF will be going to Hawaii in April and AP will join them. AP plans on attending the cluster activity this month."
3592010,"AD spoke with HD Ed on 2/22. All is going very well with Janine. HF has had time to ski often this winter with the large amount of snowfall we have been experiencing, usually 3 times per week! No concerns. AP is social and taking classes and seems happy."
3592009,"HD Chris returned my call. All is going well with Valentina and Tucker. They have a wonderful close relationship. AP is taking classes on the weekends in NYC, so AP is not able to join the family as often as in the past for weekend activity."
3592008,"AD spoke with HM on 2/16. Aida is nice and the children really like her, but HM seems to feel that there is an area of mystery to her. AP does not socialize much outside of the home. Her boyfriend arrived from Spain to visit. AP is taking a class which HF will pay for upon completion. No concerns."
3592007,"HM Sue returned my call request. They have all been busy enjoying the ski house in PA with all the snow this season. Isabelle has enjoyed having free time to ski with the family as HM's sister is pregnant and cares for Travis. HM said that AP is a little down as her boyfriend returned home, and her mom is ill. HM had a game nite and this seemed to cheer Isabelle up. HM also gave AD some information about upcoming events in their area to hopefully have APC present."
3592006,"HM Kelly said that all is well with Monika and Ryan, and that they are due to deliver any moment another baby girl! AD reviewed the 3 month requirement of not having AP alone with baby."
3592005,"HM Romy said that so far all is going very well. AP has a good relationship with her mother who is remaining in the home until 3/1 to assist with the training, as well as HM and Derek. The children really like Camila and AP is getting acclimated to the home, schedule, and town. AP has met friends and gone out socially as well. AO will be 2/24 7pm."
3592001,"AD spoke with HM on 2/18. All is great with Saskia. HF is so pleased that she has a wonderful relationship with Nicholas who is usually left out due to the attention of the twins. AP includes Nicholas in baking, crafts, etc. AP has been busy with Valentine's activities. AP has been very flexible with the snow days. The children will be in pre-school in the fall."
3591971,Things are going well. AP's grandfather recently passed away. AP was going to go home but ended up staying. HD said AP will assist in interviewing an in country AP when it is time. HD said that AP is not interested in completing her education requirement. AD will reach out to AP and try to help persuade her to complete the education requirement so she can obtain her completion certificate. The children are doing well.
3591970,Things are going well. HM's child who is very ill has been in the hospital for 3 weeks so that has been stressful. HM had relatives and friends help AP with children and her and her husband switched on and off at the hospital. New AP Kyla just arrived and she seems great so far. She is very engaging and warm. AP Vera is inquiring about new classes and is excited to begin her extension year. HC are still doing well and AP Vera continues to do a great job.
3591966,"AP is doing ok, but she’s had a harder time with the HF and kids than other APs.  HM doesn’t have concerns and things are going well overall. They are working on their new home building project."
3591964,"Lucie went with me to and from the activity. She is doing well and enjoys the family. The kids are very different, but she likes them a lot and enjoys spending time with them. The HM reported things are much better with Lucie and she gets along well with the kids."
3591962,"HF is still considering if they will host another AP. The kids will go to daycare full time. HF is traveling for most of March to April and will decide after that. AP came to activity and brought her education papers. We spoke alone at the end and she is looking forward to going home. She was very reserved when she came this year, but she is always happy and insisted it was a good experience. She will stay in contact with the HF and with the grandparents."
3591960,HF and AP report things are going well. HM will begin a new search for their 10th year with APC. AP was traveling this weekend and enjoys spending time with various friends in the area. She has a good relationship with the HF and kids.
3591958,"AP enjoys the family. She said the oldest is hard sometimes because he thinks if the AP weren’t there he wouldn’t have to go to school. Otherwise, it’s ok. The HF is busy with work and they were gone this weekend with the kids. AP said she might consider extending with another family in the fall and she thinks they won’t have another ap because she doesn’t work so many hours. HF has had a good experience with AP. She ramped up quickly and they don’t have any concerns."
3591956,Sonia is happy so far. She spends a lot of time with Geraldine and they don’t seem to mix much with other aps. Sonia enjoys the HC and things are going well. Katie spoke to me briefly because she was at an event and said they love Sonia and things are going well. It’s a very different experience than before.
3591954,Franci has had a great relationship with the HF and continues to get along well with the kids. HM said she has some other friends she’s spending time with since Desi left. HM had no concerns. AP is also doing well and comes to activities more than she used to. She seems much happier in her extension year.
3591951,"AP is doing well. She likes the HC and Family a lot. There are no concerns. She is serious, but also smart and has a good sense of humor.  HF has no concerns and they feel she’s getting along with the kids well."
3591949,"AP has had a difficult time making friends, but she isn’t easy to get along with. She has a very strong personality and carries a lot of issues with her. She had trouble with the HC, but things are going better now. She has a good relationship with the HM. HF is happy with her and thinks things are going well."
3591947,Spoke with HF today – they like Chantelle a lot. She’s a home body though and doesn’t go out much. She’s made friends with Marisa. She is good with Aliyah and gets along well with the hf. The HM and AP are taking a class together and enjoy it. AP is happy and starting to make more friends in the area. She enjoys the HC.
3591945,HM doesn’t have concerns. AP has done well with the boys. AP is still trying to decide what she’ll do at the end of the year.
3591943,"HM has no concerns, Chelli is good with the kids and easy to get along with. AP said she doesn’t spend as much time with Rachel. She gets her ready for school and that’s it. Things are going well for them."
3591941,HM is considering her next search and when to begin. All is well with Maria. AP is doing well and has made new friends since a handful of friends have left.  HF and AP are going to Hawaii in April.
3591939,"Tassia is really happy with the family. She enjoys the kids. She is considering an ext, but she doesn’t think the HF will extend because the oldest HC is driving now.  HM has a good relationship with the AP and has enjoyed having her."
3591936,"HM will miss AP, looking fwd to new ap’s arrival. Tanja is preparing to return home. She had hoped to stay, but she hasn’t been able to work out those details. She will miss the HF and the kids."
3591934,HM has had a good experience with the AP. The AP has friends in the area with another agency. She will travel to San Francisco soon. AP is doing well and has had a good experience.  AP wasn’t happy with the schedule change in the activity at the beginning of Feb.  She asked if we would have a coffee this week and AD let her know that we have two activities in a row (Feb 23 and Mar 2) and told her about the coffee meeting in Bellevue that aps go to on Tues evenings.
3591932,"HM is working part time now, AP’s schedule is 7 to 4, they worked out the insurance and AP is not paying insurance. She will start driving the kids this week."
3591930,AP is really happy with the girls. She has good friends and she seems more engaged than she did when she first arrived.  HM has no current concerns. AP is still quiet. The other nanny moved out and AP has the room downstairs.
3591928,"HM contacted me last weekend about AP asking for extra days of vacation, to use educational stipend towards flying to brazil, and other favors she was constantly asking about. HM and I agreed to meet all together on Thursday evening Feb 20th. AD spoke with AP first and then we all spoke together. HF had been agreeing to pay her in advance and loaning her money. We discussed guidelines and paying same day every week.  AP felt bad that she had put the HF in a bad position and she did understand that.  Also she asked me about classes and I sent her links, but the classes aren’t what she prefers to take. We will discuss more, but her education requirement is already completed. AP wants to extend for another yr and stay in the area."
3591926,"HM thinks ap is really quiet, is concerned she’s homesick or doesn’t have enough energy. AP is happy with the kids and struggles more with the relationship with the HM. I see AP 2-3 times a week at school and she is very loving and nurturing with the kids. She is quiet, but she’s trying to make friends, going out and the driving has gotten better."
3591923,"HM said things are fine. It’s the same as always. Thais is good at some things, but not always high energy with the kids like rosa had hoped for. She enjoys having her though. Thais asked me about a playdate with two other kids and Rosa asked her to walk all 5 kids under 5 to the park. She asked Rosa to go with her because it was 5 kids and a lot to handle walking along the road and not knowing the other two kids and what they would do. She asked if it’s her “job” and I explained playdates are ok, but it would be better to discuss things like that ahead of time. She worked it out with Rosa, but she wanted me to know in case HM mentioned it as well. HM and I discussed AP going to Mexico and AP asked me too. There shouldn’t be any issues and I sent the docs they needed to take with them."
3591921,"HM and AD spoke this week about AP. HM said she’s great with will, but she’s concerned AP doesn’t get out or do much. AP had told other AP that there isn’t a point in making friends when they won’t see each other again. AP is happy, but stays home a lot. Otherwise AP is happy with HC and enjoys her time with the family."
3591919,"HM called me because Poly got upset with the boys and was ready to go home to brazil. I spoke to AP and she said things are ok now, but it was a really tough time with them. Also, it’s feb and the weather is bad and it’s a tough time of the year. She and the HM worked it out."
3591917,"Lali and I discussed what she needs to go to Mexico and I sent her the docs. Things are going really well for her. HM said AP is going to Mexico for vacation and boyfriend will go with her. I asked if she thought lali would get married and stay and she said no, lali wants to take her time and do this right. She is planning to return at the end of the year.  They have really enjoyed having her."
3591915,"AP just arrived. So far things are going well. AP came to the activity with another friend, but over an hour late.  She spoke in German to another friend most of the time. AO set for tomorrow."
3591912,"Linda just arrived, her english is good. She is very soft spoken, but eager to meet others. She came to the activity today. She is doing well so far and we will meet later this week."
3591911,AP just arrived. She is happy with the family and went skiing today with them. We will meet later this week.
3591909,"Claire said that AP is still working on driving. They have enjoyed having her. They will not continue in the program after this year since the kids will go to school full time.  AP told me she will take driving lessons. She has enjoyed the family and has good friends in the area, mostly Franci and Maria. She wants to extend for another year and will work on the ext paperwork when she finishes her classes at the end of winter quarter."
3591905,"Janaina is happy with the family. She’s sad to be leaving soon. She wanted to stay, but it won’t work out. Today was her birthday and she celebrated with friends. HM has no concerns and will miss Janaina when she’s gone."
3591903,"HM said AP is doing well. AP Is quiet, but is happy with the HF. HM said they will be out of the country next month for about 10 days and said we could talk before they leave. AP will go with HF."
3591901,AP is doing well. HM is very pleased with her. Wants AP to take time off in May and she will go to Montana. HM Is expecting a new baby boy at the end of April beginning of May. AP will be gone next weekend to Portland.
3591889,Paul and Liz are doing great so far. See note below.
3591864,HM says there have been a few things come up but nothing they have not been able to wok out. she says AP is good with children but does not have much better English than when she arrived.. she has tried to improve but found it difficult AP took many courses in English and completed her coursework..  no questions at this time.
3591863,HM says there have been a few very smaill issues but nothing they have not been able to work out. she says AP is good with children and got her SS card.. looking into schools. no questions at this time. AP has made friends and enjoys activities and dinners with HF.
3591861,HM says there have been a few small issues but nothing they have not been able to wok out. she says AP is good with children and got her SS card.. looking into schools. no quesitons at this time.
3591857,"HM has spend a lot of time trying to help the AP find a course that she liked. AD also contact SCAD and gave many options to HM. HM was getting a bit frustrated, but finally we think the AP will try to take some English courses at EFI.  AP does not feel comfortable driving, which is ok for childcare needs, but HM will have to work with AP about fitting it into their schedule."
3591855,HM says all is well with AP. She had questions about her invoice and then looked up and found the email that explained the payment plan.
3591853,HM says all is going well with AP. They would like to help host an info meeting in their subdivision. HM will send AD info about this.
3591850,HF is doing well so far with AP. They attended the AP meeting and are starting to work this week.
3591848,"HM says all is going fine with AP. She was a little out of sorts when she returned from her trip with her parents and was also delayed upon returning because of the weather. HF and AP spoke about extending and AP decided to go with another HF. HF is fine with this, but wish the AP had made a decision earlier and are not sure what she is looking for. HF plans to look for another AP and would like to make a decision quickly since HM is expecting another baby very soon."
3591846,AP is fine and HF will stay with match until end.  Though AP is not as strong in developing relationships with kids and AP is not part of the family.  Very different than previous AP HF would prefer AP engaged with family but will stick with match
3591842,"HF is struggling with the relationship with the AP. With previous AP's the HF has had, they've been involved with the family and treated as a member of the family. HM says this AP treats the situation as a job. Shows up for work and doesn't interact with the family outside of work hours and only speaks to HM via text. HM says AP's relationship with their 3 year old is still strained and AP doesn't seem to know how to handle him and doesn't 'play' with the boys very well. HM says that AP also still hasn't completed her online driver's ed course, that it should have only taken about 6 hours and it's been 7 weeks. HF seems determined to continue to work with the AP because she is trying to improve, but it's been a 'source of frustration' for the HM."
3591841,Spoke with Hm and everything is good. Discussed having current Ap leaving early. Ad will advise after discussion with Ap
3591838,Well. HF is interested in extending with the current AP but unsure as to whether or not AP wants to. AP has mentioned she wants to continue her education but is unable to afford the cost for the American universities. AD agreed to discuss the details with the AP.
3591833,Everything is going great.  They were at a swim meet in Loveland all weekend.  It was great seeing Meli at our monthly event at bowling.  The family was inquiring about getting a statement for tax purposes and we discussed that.
3591827,Everything is going well. I talked to HD about renewal process but he still not sure if they will re-apply.
3591825,Everything is going great.
3591824,Everything is going great as usual.

AD mentioned she'd heard from AP that she has friends to stay for the 10 days between her PY ending and her flight home - HM said AP is staying with boyfriend and that they had offered numerous times to have AP stay with them - all is well, ending on great terms - they're excited for new AP to arrive, only a little over a week away!"
3591598,"AD spoke with HM who was apologetic about going to APIA for when this AP leaves - says she always reviews both agencies to increase pool of candidates and this time found a great one from Czech - but it is no reflection on APC or AD, with whom she's had great experience - she said next year she will again consider both agencies - they are very sorry to see AP go, they wish they could have her forever but she needs to return to Germany before universities let out so she can more easily find a job and an apartment"
3591595,"Everything is great - AP fits right in to family and routine, plus seems to have made friends and is getting out - all is well!"

3591522,great
3591510,"HM spoke to Hanna today about a rematch. Both parties agreed it would be for the best. HM & HD really like Hanna and have no problems with her.

3591455,Good
3591454,Good
3591452,Great.
3591451,Very well.  They are really happy with Estefania.  She sometimes has good ideas that the HP haven't even thought of.  She did leave Giuliana on the changing table and turned her back - her HD saw it and spoke with her about it.  Amylynn said she takes suggestions well though.  They have adjusted well to each other and Amylynn says that Estefania has made a lot of friends and has been going out every weekend.  She passed her driver's test the first time and now has her driver's license.
3591444,very well. AP is picking up learning very quickly and everyone is adjusting nicely.

3591442,Very well.  Bruna had a great time on her vacation.  Teresa is going to hook her iphone up to the TV so they can view her photos this weekend.  Bruna helped Teresa with Katie's recent girl scout program. It was International night and they had to cook Int'l food and sing an Int'l song.  Teresa said it went well.  She knows about my next event and expects Bruna will attend.  She'll put it on the family calendar.
3591440,Very well.  Asli fits in very well with their family.  She is calm and sweet with the boys.  She has made some au pair friends and she has family in the area too (a cousin).  Things are going smoothly.  She is in school now too and should have her license in the next two weeks or so.
3591439,Mari Lii is doing a very good job. She is responsible and very sweet. HM said she feels bad for not having enough time to spend with Mari Lii and bond. Mari Lii started to volunteer and collect under 2 hours. Their baby is due in July. She seems to enjoy spending time with the little ones.
3591438,"Fine.  Iris said she thought Aurore was doing fine ""as far as she knows"".  She got me some information on how to get discounted dental work for au pairs.  She still needs to send me contact info but she explained how much can be saved.  She is never easy to get in touch with.  I'm always chasing her for my monthly contact."
3591437,"Sarah is doing a very good job. She is very sweet, smart and responsible."
3591436,Miguel continues to do a good job. HM had a question about the car use. They never asked Miguel to pay for any gas but he is driving more than their au pairs in the pass and gas bill is much higher. HM wanted to know what is the best way to track miles. I gave HM few suggestions.
3591435,"HF is ready to start looking for a new au pair. Spoke to HM about reapplying. She will start this week. HM said she loves Pavlina and it will be very hard to replace her. Pavlina is not just an au pair, she I her friend, her sister.. she is easy to connect with. HF would like to match with someone mature and a good driver."
3591426,OK
3591406,Everything is fine with Viky and the family.  She is trying to interview as much as possible but they have been very busy with work.  Her husband is traveling now and she leaves tomorrow and sees him at an airport got 4 hours.  They may interview then.

3591389,"HM reports that things are going great this month, no problems."
3591379,Very well.  Lele told Kara that she spoke with me recently.  I asked Kara to make sure Lele knows about my March event so she is sure to come.  She did not come to the tubing event in Feb.  Kara said things are going great with Lele – no problems at all.  They are looking forward to spring though.  The school snow days have been rough on everyone.
3591376,All is going great -
3591375,HM is very happy with AP - all is going well
3591371,HM says that they are good - no issues
3591370,All is good - no issues
3591368,Fine.  I called Jen at home because I couldn't reach her at work.  Turns out she was home sick.  She said things are fine but Natascha seems blue.  She thinks it is because she doesn't get out during the week when the girls are at school.  She believes its because of the hard winter we've had.  Spring will likely help her feel better and more interested in doing things.
3591365,Very well.  I told Josephina that I had coffee with Franzi and it went really well.  I shared my perspective with her and she agreed that Franzi is very soft spoken and passive.  That works in some ways with her children and in some ways it is challenging.  The children try to get over on her at times.  Overall things are going well - Franzi strikes a good balance of spending time with the family and doing her own thing.  The HP are trying to figure out what they'll do next because they will likely move back to South Africa.
3591361,Very well.  The family is leaving town today to go to Disney in Orlando.  They are taking Maira with them and everyone is really excited.  Things are going well.  I asked Kate to encourage Maira to come to my March event since she wasn't able to come for snow tubing.
3591360,Very well.  They love Cheryl and hope she'll extend with them.  They are talking about a 9 month extension max.  Things have been challenging with all the snow days but Cheryl has a really positive attiude. They are quite impressed with her.
3591347,great
3591340,Good the transition is going well
3591332,I spoke to Joe and he said everything is going well.  He said they would like to do the arrival orientation this week on  Thursday night at 5:30.  They said so far so good with Veronica and the kids seem to like her so far.  He said Veronica will be coming to the aupair meeting with Signe today and she is looking forward to that.  He thanked me for the call and said he will see me Thursday night. Cell phone 910-916-4315 or 910-723-5336
3591319,Nikki said that things are going well with Bia  despite everyone being snowed in a great deal of the time. Talked about how nice it was that Bia wanted to collect the can goods for the food bank.
3591314,Rob said that things are going well with Camila. They are looking forward to Spring. They managed well while she was on her trip to Cancun.
3591306,"Mike said things are going very well with Camila, and her mother’s visit. He mentioned that things were a bit bumpy last month.  They felt that Camilla was not engaging with the boys as usual. Things are back to normal,he feels it was due to anxiety over Camilla’s mother’s arrival. As of this week, Jill went to P ,she is thrilled. She is now home every Mon. & Wed. There was an incident where Jill asked Camilla to work on Wed.’s now that her schedule has changed. Camilla did not want to do this, as she had made plans to do day trips with her mother on Wed’s while she is here. They worked this out."
3591302,Things are going very well.  HM still plans to extend once the APs class is complete in March.

3591290,I spokewith Mike and he said all is well with Melanie and she is going to Florida next month to visit with Justine ( former au pair. )  Mike said the kids love her and all is well. Melanie is thinking of extending.
3591288,Rekha returned my call and she said she is a little concerned because Clea has not been inregular contact with her.  I said this was not that unusual and that if it continued she could reach out to Jeffrey so he could make contact with her.
3591265,much better
3591242,"Checked in with Emma and the family and everything is going very well, and all is good with Shiori. they are happy and are all having a great time with her. it is all very different form how it was with the other AP before."
3591237,"connected with the family right before they left for a trip to Hawaii, they are all good"
3591217,Very good. Talked to Kerry and he is going to talk to his wife about when they will repeat. They are enjoying their au pair and disappointed she doesn't want to extend.
3591213,Great. Want another aupair like Julia. Told host mom to reapply by May. Possibly look at Germany as an option if no Austrian au pairs are available.
3591211,Very good. Host mom said she is not repeating want their privacy and its a little expensive as they have one child in preschool full time as well.
3591199,Winding up their year with Karin and now ready to start looking for a new AP.
3591156,It is going just fine.  They want to LA and took Laura along.  They also took her skiing as a birthday gift. She loved it - but realizes she won't be doing that in Mexico.  She is planning to return home.to go back to school.  She is happy!!

3591138,Everything is great.  Nothing to report.  The kids are on their winter break so Laura has taken them on little trips every day - today they went to Shoreline park.  Laura loves her photography class and has gotten praise from her teacher and classmates on her work.  She plans t go to Canada in the Spring.  She wants to drive across the border to meet a friend.  .  .
3591132,Good family moved to walnut creek for two weeks  while house was put on the market. They hope to sell it in March or April and rent it until school gets out Family is moving to Houston
3591118,"They are doing really well, just crazy busy.  The HM took a new job and were trying to pick their next au pair at the same time so things have been nutty to say the least.  She said there will be a gap between her current au pair and the next one but they have plenty of family to help."
3591106,They are doing really well.  They are waiting for Nettie to finish school so they can submit paperwork for her extension.  It is due in April so she should have her paperwork anytime. They are excited to have her for another year.  They said things are great and that she loves the boys.

I told her she would just have to wait 2 years and then should could come back if she was 26 or under.  I also let her know if Mayra extended for a year then Sylmara would be eligible to come right as Mayra had to go home.
3591077,"They are doing great.  She is having fun!  They really get along great.  HM & I discussed how the girls are all doing on the street.  There was tension awhile back due to some ""clicks"" and some feelings getting hurt but it sounds like everyone is doing much better."

AP left HC with 2 other AP's and their HC for a play date while she left home to pick up other HC.  HF was concerned for liability issues and for the fact that unknown house guests where in her home.

AD suggested they have that conversation with AP to motivate her to practice and take lessons.  AD mentioned that AP must also complete her education before she can apply to extend.  HM stated that is also another area where they cannot motivate her.  AD stated it's acceptable to be firm with AP and make sure she understand the importance of the coursework.

She got her VA license already, and will register at LADO next week.  She said she has already met and made friends with several APs in our group."
3589567,HM said things are going great. HM asked about when she should decide about extending.  HM said they are not sure if they will extend since aunt may come to live with them and they wouldn't need an AP.

3589362,HM said AP was not home before curfew and HM texted AP who said she would be home soon but she did not show up for 45 minutes.  HM said they have been very lax with the rules since they've always trusted AP.  AP was staying at her friend's house next door and AP texted HM to say she was going to stay the night (prior to a work night) and HM texted back to say she wanted AP to come home but AP never responded and never showed up.  I told HM that AP should be staying at their house the night before a work day.  HM said she thinks AP is pulling away from HF because she is so sad about having to go home after 2 years.  HM said AP told her she has a boyfriend and HM said she feels hurt that AP did not feel comfortable telling her about the boyfriend earlier.  I told HM I would speak to AP about recent events.

HM doesn't need her to drive the kids, but would like for her to get a driver license, so she can travel back and forth from Napa during the summer. HF has decided not to extend with her, just because they feel that a new ap has more enthusiasm and is a better fit for them."

3589150,"AP is out of town in Czech, hf is missing her a lot, she'll be back on Sunday and hf can't wait!

HM told me that Ipek's friend wasn't a strong driver."
3589079,AD spoke to HM and she says that things are going very well.
3589051,"I have been in contact with Amy  over the past few days as there have been some bumps in the road with Malu. I have attached her email below. I am encouraging explicit communication between HF + AP as they move forward. I am willing to come in for an in-home mediation to help salvage this relationship. For now Amy says that they will try having a conversation this weekend between themselves.   Hi Tami, There are some minor issues and some major issues.  I've spoken to Malu numerous times about things and some things got better but some didn't change.  There is a language issue but there's also a common sense, poor memory and bad judgement issue or maybe just plain laziness.  I guess we are still figuring that one out.  I actually asked Kevin to speak to her Monday night because I've spoken to her so many times about so many issues, that I felt she might need to hear things in different words from someone else.   One of the major issues is with a car seat.  I asked her one time, when I was in an evening gown, to bring Khloe down and put her in her car seat.  I had to hold up my dress so it wouldn't get dirty or wet.  She couldn't figure out the car seat.  So, I got out of the car and showed her how to use it.  Then, one of the only 2 times I let her drive with Khloe, she went to my mother's house to pick Khloe up.  My mother walked out to the car to say goodbye to Khloe and saw that Malu only buckled the top plastic buckle and didn't snap in the 2 metal pieces that secure the belt. My mother had to say something and then Malu easily snapped them into place. So it wasn't a matter of the straps not fitting or anything. She still hasn't really given us a good answer as to what happened.  It scares me that Malu would have driven the car with Khloe not secure in her car seat.  That's a major safety issue.  That plastic piece would easily snap in a car accident.  For now she is not driving with Khloe.   Khloe's sippy cups get washed by hand.  Several times I've taken a sip of Khloe's milk to make sure it's not too warm or gone sour and it tastes like soap.  I told Malu a bunch of times to make sure she rinses them enough.  Then Kevin went to fill a cup with water for Khloe and it filled completely with bubbles because it had a layer of soap in the bottom.  I don't want my child eating soap.   There are a lot of things she can't remember.  I had to ask her 5 days in a row if she brushed Khloe's teeth in the morning.  Finally she said she would put a reminder in her ipod to remind her.  Then she remembered.  I asked her about 5 times when we left the house if she turned the heat down in her room.  She said she can't remember to do that so she's going to leave it at 65 all the time.  She shouldn't have to do that but if she wants to, what can I say?  So she left for the weekend.  We had ice building up in the gutters.  The roof in her room was leaking.  We went in there and the heat was up.  I had to put a big note on her thermostat.  By the way, she had the heat up to 90 when she first arrived!!  I didn't even know the heat went that high!   I've had to talk to her about being on her phone, on facebook or texting or skypping while she's supposed to be interacting with Khloe.  She actually lied about having a boyfriend when we interviewed her.  Then she said she had to lie to us about it because that's what the au pair agency advised her to do.   She took raw chicken and dipped it in flour then took the flour and put it back in the pantry to use again.  I spoke with her about being careful with chicken because of salmonella.  She is supposed to be a chef so I thought she would know these things.  Then she was using the same cutting board and knife for vegetables. When Kevin spoke to her about it she said she didn't know anything about it, but I already had that conversation with her.   I think part of the problem is that she just nods her head sometimes and doesn't know what we are saying.  We've told her we'd rather explain things 10 different ways or look up words in Portuguese than have her not understand us and miss something important.   She was downloading music illegally.  I received a few notices and I wasn't sure why that was happening. She told me it was her and she would stop.  She said she didn't know it was illegal.  I had to sign into my Internet provider with my password to confirm it was me. Then it told me about the litigation process I may have to go through because of the illegal music downloading/sharing.  Then about a week later I got another notice.  Then she denied that it was her.   So, there are way too many things to write about and I can't touch on them all but those I would say were some of the major ones.  I hope the serious conversation Kevin had with her on Monday night will change things.  I never had to ask Kevin to talk to Ana one time in her year here.  I like Malu.  She's a nice person.  I just don't know if it's going to work but I will keep you posted.   Amy"

3588990,"Everything is good, ap is doing well, hf don't think she wants to extend, and that's ok, she's been great with the baby but when all 4 kids are home, it's hard for her.  That's ok too, they understand that but if they do get another one, they'll look for someone a little less quiet, outgoing and able to handle everyone."
3588985,HM says things are good.  She says AP is doing well and there are no issues with the kids.  She thinks AP is settling in nicely.
3588975,"Mom says AP Paloma arrived uneventfully, Hkids were excited to have an AP again and wanted to meet Paloma so Hmom allowed kids to stay home from school so that they could go with mom to pick Paloma up.  Mom is excited to have an AP again especially since they are now in their new house and there are still things to unpack and do from their move."

3588863,Spoke briefly to HD. All is well. Tahita is currently on vacation
3588859,"Spoke with Yeong-Ping. Overall doing great with the kids, English is good, proactive, cleaning up after the kids.  Her driving is actually problematic. Not up to par. Provided him a referral for a driving instruction. For now, doubling up with nanny/au pair. Also, needs a bit more instruction than the other APS they have had."
3588844,HM says things are good and she had no issues to bring up.
3588829,"Franzie is doing great. The HF couldn't be happier. HM has not been felling well, but they will start search soon. Made HM aware of the early matching discount"
3588825,"HM says new AP is fantastic.  She says she is smart, proactive and great with the kids.  She says there has been no transition issues and she can not believe how  lucky they have been to have had three great APs in a row."
3588823,"The HM stated everything is going okay. I questioned the AP being bitten by the raccoon.  She stated this was one of the examples of what she discussed with me last month regarding the AP's maturity.  The HF had seen raccoons close to the house as close as in the drive way, so they told the AP about the raccoons and not to touch them because they are wild animals.  The AP takes walks every evening which the HF has advised against but she has not listened to them (another example of her immaturity).  At any rate the AP came to the HM three days later and asked her to look at her finger (she is a doctor).  The Hm look and said it look like a simple wound which would heal and in conversation asked ""what happen?""  This is when she found out the AP tried to pet the raccoon and it bit the AP. She immediately tells the AP she needs to go to the doctor.  They took her and she has had the rabies shots. The AP has also has gotten two speed camera tickets. The HF has spoken to the AP regarding her level of responsibility as far as driving.  The AP also slammed one of the boys hand in a door but did not make anyone aware of the incident.  They explained that accidents happen but she should always inform someone when something happens. The family declined a mediation and chalked everything up to growing pains but  they are concerned about why the AP doesn't follow instructions. I explained I had spoken to her for the monthly call but would see her Sunday for the Monthly Event and would speak with her."
3588806,HM says things are great.  No problems.
3588804,"HM at work and can't talk too long.  Emilie is doing a great job, she's a real sweetheart and they are all very happy.  She's taking an advanced English class which hm feels is good for her.  HM feels they will need another ap for the year, so they will renew or extend with Emilie if she would."
3588792,things are going well - Rachel was not on vacation this week so they had to juggle the care for the kids as Mai had her class too.  She is very happy and they have a couple of things planned for her family who are coming from Germany for a few weeks and we talked about things that they could do locally.
3588790,Spoke with HD.  He says everything is good so far.  AP had her first full day yesterday and will be driving solo this afternoon to pick up the kids.  HD says the kids seem to be warming up quickly to AP.  APO will be conducted next week.

Yudy claims her friend took the keys from her purse without permission and the friend says hat Yudy gave her permission  AD has reviewed au pair Care policy that each au pair is only obligated to pay $250.00 per accident.  Encouraged HM to file with her insurance company as this accident happened under Yudys watch and it is HM car not the other au pair.  HM said she would talk about it with her husband tonight.  She agreed it is difficult since the au pairs are telling different stories.
3588767,Great. HF going to a dude ranch for a few days.  AP going to get ss card and then get CTDL.  Sent AP letter for DMV.
3588765,"Everything is great, hm was surprised to find snow this morning!  They are going to look for another Danish au pair when Nina is done.  Advised hm to start now as the Danes are few.  She'll go into FR and update her app and I will put matching notes in for Annika."
3588763,"Dad reports that APs overall childcare is just o.k. there are a few things that have HF concerned at times. Examples:  Both Hmom and AP were in kitchen together, Hmom was cooking and left a spatula too close to the burner, spatula caught on fire.  Hmom said AP watched the spatula burn for about 5 seconds or so, which is about the time mom turned around and saw it burning herself,  mom grabbed it and threw it in the sink and turned the water on.  Hmom wonders why AP did not react sooner, especially when she saw it burning.  Hmom and Hdad hope nothing bad happens in the future as they are unsure how AP will react in an emergency when she is alone."
3588762,AD spoke to HM and she says that everything is great with their AP.
3588759,"HD called with some questions.  HF still deciding what their childcare needs will be.  Asked about extension process as AP definitely wants to travel to SA to attend cousin's wedding during extension year.  Discussed need to get visa renewed. HD wanted a timeline to decide, and told him about 6/1 extension deadline, and June match deadlines for a July arrival, should they decide to go that route. Basically, they would need to have a plan by May."
3588758,Things are going exceptionally well.  They had a great trip.  Last year their first AP was a little homesick and it impacted the trip.  This year Risa shows no signs of homesickness and they all really enjoyed themselves.
3588729,"good except ap failed her driver's test, she is not confident, hf has to pay for taxi to get the children where they have to go, will take it again, but hf doesn't have much hope she will pass as she is not a good driver, hesitates, also waits til last minute to do  projects with children etc,not pro-active, also has boyfriend and putting all  her effort into that ""being in love"". hf will let me know how things go and if they need me to step in"
3588723,"AP has been great, no problems or issues and HM hopes the AP is happy as well."
3588715,HM says that AP Grandfather just dies and she needs to go home for the funeral - reviewed all the documents that she needs to take with her.
3588707,"HF is very excited to extend with their AP for another year, they are very happy with Kate."
3588702,AD spoke to HD and he says that everything is going great!
3588700,"HF is very happy with their AP. They moved into a new home end of January and I scheduled a visit with the HF and AP for Wed, Feb 26th."
3588698,"all good, at first english skills were a little weak and mom wasn't sure how much she really understood but taking class at the library and doing a great job with the children,"
3588690,"hm got back to me, all good, no questions, Lisa finished  her classes and thinks she sent the proof to SF, if not, she will send to me..."
3588685,"all good, baby is doing well and things are good with Sahika, might want to extend and spoke a little about the process, timing and suggested she check it out in the FR"
3588679,Everything is fabulous! No complaints. HM is in ER so she can't talk.
3588675,"Spoke with Caroline and it's Karen's Birthday.  She's having a surprise birthday party for her tonight.  Everything is going great.  She asked about releasing Karen early since the family with be going to France in July.  We also discussed the fact that she does not want to extend with Karen and how to have that conversation, as she is certain that Karen would want to extend with them.  She is not yet sure she will want another AP but thinks they probably will since 4 kids are difficult.  She also wants to put the little one's in preschool so she needs to determine if they can afford an AP and Preschool.  I told she would need to start the ""matching"" process in May and that I would email her the arrival dates."
3588652,Pretty good.  HM said Luanna wants them to extend another year and then be her sponsor to go to school.  They are going to talk to her and tell her they are not really wanting to make that commitment.  HM said Luanna is good with the kids but they really want someone with more flexibility and someone who would like to be part of the family.  Luanna only wants to work 7-4 and then she is out the door.
3588639,"Good, AP is good with girls, and very sweet. Seems to be better now that APs family was her to visit, AP has been out more and visually happier."
3588635,Spoke with Eloiza.  We talked again about starting the matching process again in April so she can have someone here when Maria leaves in July.  She said everything has been going great.
3588634,"Hmom is excited to have re-matched with another French AP, HF feels good about new AP Alycia and are looking forward to meeting her upon her arrival. Hmom reports that current AP Clemence has shown no improvement and shows no signs of emotions during this transition.  Mom reports that Clemence looks very tired and hopes she is feeling o.k.  Hmom knows she has to pay outgoing AP Clemence 4 days worth of vacation and will do so before she leaves."
3588631,"HM Lucia (LOO-shuh) and AD had a very lengthy and pleasant conversation, talking about plans for three (at first) and then two APs.  They will work rotating shifts, and they all share meals together and everyone has their own room.  Everything is great with AP Matilda; her schedule is modified, currently, as she has been sick -- in order to keep germs away from baby.  HM very enthusiastic about the coming year."
3588627,"Great, AP will be traveling to Cananda with HF twice this month, AP has been so great with HF and HC and they are talking about extension."
3588625,HD says that they have their up and downs. He acknowledges that HM is very particular in her requests and that creates friction in his home. AP and HM have weekly meetings to talk about issues and work it out.
3588624,"Ap is wonderful, very sweet and kind to HC. HF may be moving this spring/summer due to job change..TBA"

3588601,"Everything is going well. AP has still not received her SS card and I told HM it would be best for her to go back to the office and talk to them in person. HM also said that AP registered for classes and then cancelled and HM was charged $20. She asked if she should take it out of AP's paycheck or eat the cost. I said it was up to her, but she couldn't take it out of the paycheck, she could take it out of the education stipend if that's what she decides."
3588581,Everything is going well so far. AP is getting up to speed and HM doesn't have any concerns at this point.
3588575,"Great, though AP hurt her ankle playing handball 2 nights ago. She went to the dr. and they are awaiting x-ray results just to be sure it's not fractured."
3588559,Spoke with Danielle.  She had a question regarding her AP getting into a car accident.  Vera has had 2 minor accidents and HM wonders if AP is responsible for 2 $250 deductibles.  (Emailed her that it is per accident)
3588523,"all good, children are  home and mom is doing fun things with them, Andrea is on vacation and should be coming with her family to visit later in the week, no questions and all rules are being followed"
3588522,OK.  HM said they are frustrated with the program.  They have selected a nanny and will not be getting another AP at this time.  HM said AP may be a better choice when their kids are older
3588516,Just looking for our next AP. So far I have not had any luck. HM said she hopes to find one soon.
3588446,"AD talked to HM last week, she had called back. All is well with AP she is doing fine, just after work she is going to her room and likes to be alone."

Shouldn't she use her stipend for that?""  I assured her she did need to supply enough food for the AP.

3587716,"HM says that AP is lovely and they like her a lot. She could be a little firmer with the kids; HM is concerned they may take advantage of her sweet nature. HM is encouraging AP to get out and make friends as she knows that's important. But overall, things are going well."
3587712,AP continues to do a great job. HM is sad just thinking about her leaving. New baby is due the end of April. They'll reapply next month and have the next AP arrive in late June so there will be two APs for a few months when the baby is very small.

She hasn't bonded well with their younger son.  Nora is bothered by this.  I counseled her on how to handle this and she is going to sit down with Inga to let her know this is really bothering her. If she doesn't address this now it will only get worse.  Her son tells her that he doesn't like Inga.  Nora has left the two of them alone together so they could bond.  I suggested she do this more often if possible.  Inga is a bit of a girly girl which might account for the challenge in bonding with her son."

Her two best friends left to go back to Sweden which bothered her a lot but she seems to have made some new friends now.

3586421,HM stated everything is going really well.  HM stated she wishes AP would meet more people but AP has been trying and going out on weekends.  HM stated the weather is depressing AP.  AD mentioned weekly get togethers at Starbucks in South Orange and cluster meeting on 2/23.  AD will encourage AP to attend cluster meetings and weekly gatherings so she can meet more APs.  AD also mentioned FB page.
3586409,I offered my help or assistance with getting another AP should they decide that is what they want to do.  Told Hm I will miss Alejandra and all the pictures of her and the kids on Facebook.  She said they are still deciding.
3586406,AD called to make certain that the HF has all her contact information since they are relocating to St Louis. HM was glad to speak with AD and thanked her for calling. She said things have been pretty hectic during the move but is glad to have finally bought a house and is going to begin a search for preschools for her oldest child. HM plans to call AD with some questions as they get settled more. AD welcomed HF to St Louis!
3586405,Spoke with Kelly. She said things are great with Carina. Today is her birthday. They had a birthday party yesterday  and are going to dinner today.
3586400,It is going very well. HM is a little stressed about AP going home for two weeks. She leaves this Sunday to see her family before she starts her extension.. HM has cared lined up for the two weeks and her parents are coming first week of March to help her out.
3586390,HM stated everything is status quo.  All issues re improving and getting better.

3586375,Good.  Lucie is great with Owen and Noah.  She is a good addition to their home.
3586361,"It is going overall well. HM is a little concerned that the AP does not socialize more. She has not made any attempt to meet the other girls and hang out with them. She spends her free time in her room , though she seems happy it is a little troubling to the HF that she does not get out at all. It is a difficult time for the HF right now since they are in the middle of a move. The HD has already moved to Madison and started his new job and the HM is here wrapping up her practice. They will now move at the end of March. They will live in something temporary until the snow is gone and then they will look at buying a house in Madison"
3586344,HF had questions regarding the early release of the AP. HM shared Miku has not decided yet about the extension. If she decides to extend HF would be glad to have her but if she does not they would like to release her early because in June they are going to Japan for a month. HM said she does not want to do anything against the APC agreement. I discussed with HM early release process and financial aspect of it.
3586338,"HM shared Deia is wonderful and she is doing a great job with the kids. They are having a very good experience. Unfortunately, Deia decided to go back to Brazil after her first year. HM is very sad but she understands Deia's reasons. HF is back in selection."
3586333,"Everything is fine, they get their new AP soon.  March 7th will be Marina's last day with them.  She needs her to work from 7-9 am and then Marina is free to move over to the Rechter family."
3586326,Everything is going well.  I did tell the HFM that I have tried to leave msgs for their AP but she takes a long time to respond and to please remind her of the importance of getting back to me every month.
3586319,things are going well. They are at the end of their time with Josefine and now looking for a replacement
3586317,AD spoke with HM and asked if smoking and late issues have been resolved.  HM stated that she and AP just went on 8 day vacation together and it was wonderful.  HM stated that AP is still having trouble getting up on time for work in the morning but she is making an effort.  HM stated that AP is just a late person but she is willing to overlook it because AP is so great with HC and is a good fit for HF.  HM stated she thought she would want to extend with AP but not is not sure.  HM stated she will think about whether or not she would want to extend.
3586316,"HM said things are settling a bit.  Work on the house has begun.  AP seems to be feeling more comfortable but HM is still concerned AP is not happy.  HM is concerned AP may not really want to be an AP for the year.  HM has continued to ask AP and she says she is fine.  AD suggested since there has been so much ""uproar"" that HF give her another few weeks to see if AP seems happier.  AD encouraged AP to attend social planned for the weekend.  HM agreed.  HM is very concerned about AP driving and will not let her drive the car yet HM and HF continue to work with AP on her driving"
3586315,Well.  Meg told me that Tania has decided not to extend with them.  She told them that she is going home when she finishes the program.  She told me that she wants to extend with another family when I saw her last so I'm not sure what happened.  We talked a lot about rematching.  We also talked about the importance of finding an au pair who doesn't have to speak a lot of spanish at home because they come here to perfect their english.
3586310,Very well.  Allison is so happy with Mari - she couldn't say enough great things about her.  She told me that she is the best au pair she's ever had.  She's part of the family and they are hoping to extend with her.  Allison called again to say that her mother died suddenly Monday and Mari has been an awesome support.  She has offered to help in any way she can and has been very empathetic and caring.
3586306,Things seem to be going very well. Veronika is a big help with Marty and Marty is fitting in great. Jill has been in touch with Karina and she did have the valve surgery and is recovering at her moms.
3586305,everything is good. AP English slowly improving she made some friends she likes to go out with
3586266,Everything continues to go well. AP will register for Spring classes again. She is taking Toefl on Saturdays.

3586240,It's fine.  The AP is so sweet and adventuresome.  Concerned about her homesickness.  HF is throwing her a little surprise party on Thursday for her birthday.  She asked me to reach out to all the other APs in the group and invite them over.  Family is working with her to by a laptop and a cell phone (her choice).  She is feeling disconnected - she uses the family laptop to skype with her family a few times a week.  She will feel better when she has a phone to reach out to others here.
3586239,everything is going very well.  no complaints.  Relived to learn that AP was not dating anyone.  AP just had a birthday and spent the weekend in San Diego with 5 other APs from our group.
3586237,"Monica is doing really well.  They are so happy with her and really enjoying her company.  HM said she has already started thinking about how much they will miss her. (and theystill have 8 more months) Ironically HM and I started talking about a surgery we both had recently, so we ended up talking for quite awhile.  They are very happy with the program."
3586236,They are busy getting ready for their transition of au pairs.  They will be sad to see Julie go and have enjoyed having her and enjoying her culture and traditions.
3586235,"AD spoke with HM and HD. They both have some concerns about AP.  AP does not agree with HF about their parenting philosophy and is having trouble enforcing their parenting style.  HM and HD stated AP has been rude to 4yo HC and have encountered resistance from AP when they have tried to discuss it with her.  HM and HD stated they want the match to work but that AP needs to learn not to take things so personal.  AD asked about status of other issues.  HM stated that they discussed AP's driving issues and had her take a driving lesson.  HM stated that the driving instructor said AP's biggest issue is not paying attention to signs while driving.  HM also stated that driving instructor stated he felt AP was a good enough driver to drive HC but that she should get more practice.  HM stated she plans to take AP out for more driving practice as recommended by driving instructor.  AD asked about flu shot issue.  HM had previously mentioned to AD that AP refused to get a flu shot.  HM stated that they decided not to push the topic right now since flu season is coming to an end and they didn't want to overwhelm AP with too many issues at once.  AD stated that HF should sit down with AP and discuss these issues and gave HF some pointers.  HD stated that he felt they had discussed these issues and because AP gave them resistance that AP might be more receptive if she got feedback from a non-partial third-party like AD.  AD stated I would call AP and talk about issues but stated that AD, AP, HM and HD may need to have a mediation to work through some of these issues.  AD will call AP and keep HF updated."
3586207,Lorena has been great and everything is still going well. HF will begin searching for a new AP in a couple of months when Lorena's time gets closer to ending.
3586206,Everything is great with AP. I discussed with HM to start thinking about if they are going to want to extend with AP. I let her know it's good to start thinking about it now and discussing with AP in the next few months if they would like her to extend or not.
3586191,AD had a pleasure of speaking with HD Scott.  He's often traveling for business and AD has been checking in with HD Todd.  Everything's going well.  HD is very happy with the way the AP has taken ownership of the responsibilities.  They will be traveling to NEw Orleans together for Mardi Gras.
3586186,"Very well.  Luana is  still doing great, they are sorry to see her go. I congratulated them on their new Au pair, and they're looking forward to meeting her."
3586185,"Very well.  HM reports that AP is coming out of her shell more, and making more friends. She is signed up for the weekend program in March, and also attending college at College of the Canyons."
3586174,"Great, loves Johanna! Breath of fresh air after last placement. Kids love her. She has met a friend Michelle so they have been out a lot together. Had planned to have our APC 101 talk this weekend but between hm and. I we haven't been able to conjure up enough interest."

3586151,Michael says that things are going well and Josefine is doing a great job with the girls.  She is driving now and that is a big deal as she can get herself places and is very interested in doing some traveling during her last month and on her vacation.  We talked about the weekend class and how to arrange the week so she can leave early to get the bus to the class.
3586146,Matt says that things are going very well and they have asked Candy to extend with them and she is thinking about it.  I told him that I thought that Candy's English was so much better and each month I can tell a big difference - he said he noticed too.  She has a group of friends who are from different countries so they are forced to speak English together.
3586142,spoke with Heather and things are great - they were very happy to have Bella's sister stay and hear all about their trip to Disney.  I told her that we are going to the Cheesecake Factory the day after my birthday and the day before Bella's!

3585913,"Spoke with Leigh. She said that things are going well. She said that it has been more of an adjustment than she anticipated. Maia speaks English very well and with very little accent, but does not comprehend well. Leigh is noticing that she is missing a lot of information. She has asked Maia to ask questions but Maia doesn't have any. Suggested Leigh talk slowly and ask Maia to repeat back what she said. Encouraged her to tell Maia that she wants to assure that Maia understands. Encouraged Leigh to meet with Maia weekly."
3585908,So far all is well. HM will help Rin open a bank account and start her classes.

3585835,Excellent.  They think she is  fantastic. They want to New Orleans for a beach holiday and Natsuki went too.  She had a good time.  They wish she would do more things with them during her free time.  They are a bit disappointed in that.  She is going to extend for 6 months only as she has a job lined up  at home.  They are thinking of inviting her mother to visit - at their expense.
3585823,"Spoke with HM and everything is wonderful, she can do with a little less snow."
3585817,Excellent.  Jae says that Gilberto is doing a great job as always.  He has decided to return to El Salvador when his program is finished in July.  He could not find a college he can afford. They will probably not get a new au pair.  They think that Peter will be okay now.

Shared she will try to just wait and see if she feels differently in the coming wks or if she feels it is best to rematch.  She does not have safety concerns with the AP at this time just worried about the baby and feels maybe the 3 is too much."
3585607,AD spoke with HM and everything is going really well with AP.  HM  stated AP is very lovely.  HF's only issue with AP is that she has been in 2 car accidents and AP totaled car in one of them.  They have been hosting APs for 9 years and this is the first AP that has had this issue.

3585487,HM said AP is doing OK. AP still does some odd things and can be very dramatic at times but they have been able to work through it.  HM asked about timing for renewal and I told her 7/1 would be a good time to re-apply and start perusing the database for a 9/4 match deadline.  HM would like a couple of days of overlap between incoming and outgoing APs for training.
3585450,HF states that they are in a pretty good ryhthm now. He rates her a B+ to B- in all categories and is overall pleased with her.

3585348,"AD spoke to HM and she says that things are going well as it relates to the care of their son, Henry. However, HM is concerned that the AP expects to attend church every Sunday between 2-4pm. HM says that she explained to the AP that it will not be possible to provide those hours every Sunday as they really need the AP to work most Sundays starting about 4pm. AP is very insistent about going to a particular church and during those specific hours; and HM says that AP doesn't seem to be that flexible. AD plans to speak with AP."
3585328,Stacy said good. They told Marianna that they don't want to extend with her and she has decided to go home.  I said thanks for letting me know.  If I can help with matching or anything else just let me know.

3585133,It is going well. AP is great with the baby and they enjoy her. She has made a lot of friends. HF has decided to not continue with the program next year and have signed baby up for daycare at UW. HM wanted to know when she should talk to AP about not extending and I said anytime would be fine but it's always good to give APs a heads up if they know what their plans are.
3585125,"The match is not going well. AP talks back and argues about everything. AP is constantly on the phone and not bonding with the older HC. She is good with the younger one, but clashes with the older one and is not patient and loving. AP had a boyfriend the first weekend she arrived and has not taken the time to get to know the family. AP expects 3 days off and is not flexible with her hours and helping when HM asks her to. HM is suffering from vertigo and has been home the last two weeks. HM has asked for meeting, Thursday  2/19."
3585117,Spoke with Hm and everything is going well. Had enough of the snow. Celebrated Ap's birthday this weekend.
3585110,"Everything is great with Ale. They are returning from a few weeks in Florida, so all are happy and doing well! Tara had asked previously re timing on new AP search or extension, but is now unsure if they will do another AP as the girls will be in PreK and all day Kindergarten beginning in the fall."
3585089,things are going ok she is better with the kids but still very quiet. Jackie had questions on when her year would be up and also on when to reapply for a new aupair
3585068,Spoke with Hm and everything is great. They would love to keep Ap.  Reminded Hm to go into family room and reapply and to start her new search.
3585059,Everything is going really well. HF is in Colorado for a wedding and AP is in Vancouver taking a few days of vacation. They don't have any concerns at the moment.
3585016,Laurel is helping Luana get set for moving to NY.  She will be staying with Martini's until Friday February 21st.  They will drive her to the airport.  They are looking forward to having Iveta come March 8th.
3584976,"HD Jeff S. had a few questions about the extension, especially regarding completion of classes and visa. I explained."
3584967,"Spoke with HD, who is always happy, and things are going great. He said AP is having difficulty getting dl but is getting better each time she takes it.  Childcare is great."
3584964,"HM needed help reapplying to the program so that she could begin matching to replace Lara.  Laura V is not a leader, but she is doing ok.  She is not the best with the toddler and needs to improve on her independence and reliance on Lara."
3584957,All is going great with Cami. HF and Kids all love her. She is doing a great job. HM had a few tax questions. I directed her to the last email I sent out with info. APC provided.
3584941,"Everyone is well.  The HC will be off from school and Hm was wondering if the AP can miss school for this.  I stated that she should check with her teacher and find out how many classes that she can miss and then work from there.  I also stated that it was ok to have her miss class if she needed to work, it is a special circumstance."
3584940,AP is doing really well and the kids love her. HF feels she needed more time to warm up and feel comfortable but now it is all good. HF is going away in APril to PR and AP will have vacation time.
3584929,"Things are going really well with Vanessa. She has an AP friend in rematch & had hoped the friend would be able to stay with HF Mihailidis during rematch. Tammy is fine with the AP friend staying on a weekend, but not during a 2 week rematch period as Tammy wants to be sure her own kids are being cared for with consistency. Also, Tammy wants to be sure situation is resolved with the APs AD and HF as best as possible first."
3584919,"Everything going well as usual. Family was considering moving because of commute issues, but HM said they decide to stay in the area and just move closer to highway. Everything else is as usual."
3584906,"Julien is really nice, but he is very up and down emotionally. Not sure what he is going through. Sometimes he is very tired and sometimes he is very upbeat."
3584899,HM told me that all is well. She informed me that she has changed her email address.
3584886,Going fine. They asked if Ivy's profile is visible yet. They want to help her find a family.
3584881,HF and AP are all traveling this week. Things are going well.
3584876,HF is looking forward to arrival new AP and hopes she does not get scared off because of all the snow. HM is traveling so HD will do the arrival meeting.
3584873,Karen is concerned that she is using Cristina too much. I told her that it will balance out over time.
3584871,"Janina is doing well. She seems a little burned out at the moment, but there has also been a lot of snow days. However the HM stated she needs her to step it up a little"
3584845,"HM Missy said that things have been busy as HM was in FL last week then HD left for S. Africa. In terms of their placement, HM told me, ""Everything is great here. No Issues."" The HF leaves for Costa Rica on 3/11/14 with their AP Nikol."
3584844,AD spoke to HM and she says that things are going really well and they are happy with Bow.
3584838,"things are going well with Juliana and all program rules are being followed, couple questions about extending  and let her know she should look in the FR about the extension program and if the ap needs to travel outside the US oin her extension year she would need to get a new visa, sent email about that with FAQ for extension."
3584832,I spoke to Jen in person and on the phone.  She said things are great with Juli.  She thanked me for helping her open her account.  She said she will be at the aupair meeting on Saturday.  She asked how long it will take and I told her it is a ways out of town and then plan onat least 1 1/2 hours while we are there.
3584818,"Everything is fine. Busy with accomodating schedules around two hour delay at BTC, with Boyertown closed (bus for BTC). Maggie and Shannon share the car to get the boys where they need to be."
3584793,Everything continues to be super with Maria. Both parties have completed their extension app & are just waiting on approval.
3584780,AD spoke to HM and she says that everything is going really well and the family has no concerns or complaints at all.
3584765,"AP is doing well. They are trying to get through winter, it has been a long one with lots of snow days. They like their AP but do not plan to extend with her. HD feels she is a one year girl and they will start the process of looking for a new person come May. They are happy with AP and no issues, she is just more calm and laid back than they are used to. Their previous AP is back in Kansas and she just got married two months ago."
3584764,"Things are going well, HD was in his office. HD asked about extension details AD explained he has a few months."
3584755,"Things are the same HD , nothing new"
3584752,All is great.. HF loves AP and appreciate the extra things she does.She is going to classes at Richland College.
3584751,HF feels they are very lucky with the AP and she is doing well. HF recently moved and they like the new house.
3584729,"AP is great and doing some nice things this week with friends and with Karina the oldest HC. HM and two youngest are in CA,"
3584723,"All is well with HF & AP.   HM is happy with Lea, she does a great job and is great with the kids."
3584722,"Marsine arrives this week, HF is very excited.  They are picking her up from the airport on Thursday evening. Will discuss all items below at the APO"
3584717,"Everything is great, HF is really happy with AP and is wishing she will extend with them."
3584711,"Everything is good, HF is happy with AP"
3584703,HF and AP are doing well since they last sat down and spoke about some smaller issues. AP is positive and big help. HF wishes she would socialize more but otherwise no concerns.
3584695,HF is on the west coast and all is doing well. AD woke HD up and he will call back if there are any questions.
3584683,"AD spoke to HD and he says that things are going okay, but he is concerned that the AP's English is not as good as he thought. AD explained that the AP just arrived and she should be allowed some time to adjust to her new surroundings. HD completely understands. HD asked questions about the AP driving during her free time. AD reminded the HD that the HF is not required to provide a car for the AP to drive during her free time. HD says that they do not need the AP to drive for work at this time."
3584677,"Well.  At the APO, Kathy said Robson was good with the boys.  She liked how he encouraged them when one said he wanted to quit a game because he wasn't any good.  He encouarged him to keep playing and he did.  She said it is a natural fit so far."
3584675,"Everything is ok, HF got match with a new AP."
3584674,"Not great.  They are still not connecting.  She said June always goes to her room when she is off, even after the kids go to bed at 7-7:30 pm and Jen is there by herself.  She thought June would want to be more a part of the family and sounded emotional about it.  She says she has offered, but June always goes to her room.  She seems very quiet, but then when she gets on Skype, she yells and talks fast.  She feels like she is complaining about them, but she doesn't know what to do.  They took her to get her DL but she failed it and husband says she doesn't have good spatial relations and doen't drive in the middle of the lane.  I suggested she try again to get June to come down afer the kids are in bed to watch a movie or hang out.  They would probably rematch but they don't want the stress of rematching and going without care.  She did make the schedule clearer so June knows she would like help on Saturdays.  Suggested that I come have a chat with everyone.  She will ask her husband."
3584669,"Well.  She really enjoys having Saori around and they hang out all of the time.  So happy she is staying for 2 years.  Caroline emailed that she was really worried about June, another AP and put a lot of details about her not being treated well, they don't spend any off time together and she can't drive so she doesn't even go to the store.  She was upset that the family didn't seem friendly to her/Caroline either when they went to pick June up.  I called her and told her that they are new and are also not pleased with June, she turns down their offers to go places and they took her to get her DL but she failed it.  There are two sides to every story and the family does want to build a relationship with June.  So I advised her to encourage June to spend time with the family and accept their offers, rather than making the problems seem worse."
3584667,"AD confirmed with HM that she had matched and is all set for next year.  HM said yes.  Her current AP's friend, Andressa, had been interested in extending with the Lindsay family, and had asked AD about it.  HM and AD let Andressa know HM had already matched."
3584664,"AD spoke with HM and AP.  Both stated they are happy in the match so far.  The HC have already taken to new AP and love her.  HF said AP is very patient and kind, and is working hard.  AP said she is glad to be included as part of the family.  The HF already took her iceskating with them, and the trip was a success!"
3584660,HM got back to AD.  She said all is going great.  AP went with a girlfriend to Chicago for the long weekend.  They will sure miss her when she leaves.
3584657,HM got back to AD.  All is going well with Sandra.  HD is currently overseas.
3584655,"HM says things are going well.  She had some questions about Nina's end date and trying to overlap next AP.  She was concerned that it seemed we have less arrival dates in Aug, than in previous years.  Trying to overlap APs one week, not 3, is proving to be difficult with Nina potentially leaving Aug 5th."
3584644,HM was traveling for work and AP did a great job. HM will start search for new AP this week.
3584627,HM says that they are still doing great with Miriam.  She and two other AP's went down to LA this weekend together and had a lot of fun!  She continues to do a great job with the kids and they are enjoying having her as a part of the family.
3584626,After talking with the HF they agreed that they wanted to see the match through.  They put their daughers in school full time so that Betty has the kids in the afternoon and early evening.  They felt that she was too negative with the girls and did not bond well.  They did not want to send her home as they feel that this is just Betty's personality.  HM said that things are AOK.
3584625,Heather has concerns about Sandra's poor English. I recommended Sandra get into the adult school ESL classes asap. Heather said she didn't initially realize Sandra's English was so weak and now that Sophie is gone it is more apparent. Heather also feels Sandra is not making an effort to b social with other APs due to her lack of confidence with her English. Told her I will talk to Sandra and see how she is doing but getting her in ESL classes is very important!
3584623,"They are doing ok.  She thinks Emi is plateauing.  She does not feel that her English is getting any better.  She said she is happy and the girls love her which is why she is still here.  She feels that she just does enough to get by.  The HM put her daughter in preK so Emi does not have a tough schedule or a lot of hours.  The HD is training on the East Coast and then will be leaving to Afghanistan in March for a year.  This is putting a huge strain on the family, emotionally, physically and financially. She is hoping they can figure everything out in order to keep Emi for the whole year that they have extended for.  She also stressed some concern about Emi taking a trip to Mexico as her visa is expiring in April.  I think she will take the trip a month before it expires and will be fine."
3584611,"very well.  She is a better AP than the other two hands down.  She still has her things to work on, but overall the complaints are outweighed by her benefit.  She feels comfortable with Bell's safety.  She feels the teaching could be better.  HM might feel comfortable traveling again and may be able to fully embrace this au pair as part of the family rather than walk on eggshells about her."
3584610,"AD spoke with HM.  HM stated that AP had just spoken to her and said that she was not comfortable staying in the house any longer because of the challenges with 6yo HC kicking and yelling at her.  HM was very supportive of AP's decision and although HM was disappointed by AP's decision, HM stated she wished AP best of luck and doesn't want her to feel uncomfortable."
3584599,Well- spoke with Caroline while she was at her son's tennis practice.  Will help Lari fill out her taxes.
3584593,Well- looking for a new AP for after when Cat leaves
3584587,HF likes Dani a lot. She is doing a great job and she is still thinking about the extension. I shared with HM what the deadline is and shared that Dani has to complete her school hours before submitting the extension application. They would like to extend for 3 months but I shared that is not an option. HM wanted to know what happens if they extend for 6 months and Dani leaves in 3. I told HM that they would receive credit for unused months but Dani would not receive her flight back home.
3584585,Jasmin is great and HF absolutely love her. They started to talk to her about possibly extending for additional 6 months. Jasmin is still thinking about it.
3584562,AP and HF have adjusted extremely well.  Ap is different than past AP.  Current AP has more friends than previous AP so she is more social.  HM notes AP tends to go out with friends after class. HM says this is different than past AP but HF is very happy with A
3584560,"Very well, before this afternoon. I received a call from HM Malko this afternoon upset because AP Trujillo was asleep when the HM returned from work early this afternoon. This has been a shaky placement for quite a while, but had been somewhat under control since our meeting in December. As a matter of fact, the HM started the call with saying how exceptionally well the placement had been going as of late...until this afternoon.     The triplets were awake in their cribs while the AP was sound asleep. When the HM asked why the AP was sleeping, the AP responded that she had a headache and didn't mean to fall asleep.     The HM said that prior to this, the HM had told the AP if she was ever not feeling well, the AP was allowed to lay down while the kids were sleeping, but to please let the HM know what was going on via text.     When I asked the HM if the AP had ever done this before she said no. I mentioned that the AP seems very contrite when things have happened in the past when the HF and the AP have talked it through and the same issue had never repeated itself again. The HM agreed.      I let the HM know that I just so happened to have an e-mail and voice message in to the AP today for the February Monthly Contact Call and that I would text the AP right after we hung up (which I did). I let the HM know that as soon as I could speak with the AP I would get back to her with the result of our conversation.     After a few minutes, HM Malko called back to say she spoke to her husband and they wanted to know what, if any penalty, they would have if they decided to terminate the placement. They feel that they are worried about the safety of their children with the AP. I again stated that this had never happened before and that the AP always seems to take (re)direction well.      I told her that they would owe the AP any unused vacation time and since they were past the 6 month mark there would be no refund/replacement, only a program credit based on the amount of time left on their program. The HM wanted to know if they would owe the AP the other $250 for her education allowance since the AP had only taken one weekend class. I told the HM I didn't think so, but I wanted to double check with you to be certain.     I told the HM that if they decided to end the placement I would need to come out and have a meeting before the final decision would be made. She agreed and said she would get back to me after talking further with the HD.     I told her as soon as I spoke to the AP I would be back in touch. I have yet to hear back from the AP but will add the conversation to the notes once it takes place."
3584559,just arrived in US today
3584557,They are in Plumas County this week and Pauline is with them - it is ski week.   Pauline has her driving license now and is taking night classes at College of Marin. They are thinking of asking Pauline to extend but we are not sure yet.
3584556,well
3584537,"Eric call me and says things are going well, as always. The family is moving to Colorado in August and will not renew."
3584536,"Not well- Celine broke and dislocated her left ankle while rollerblading.  had surgery today, will not be able to put weight on it for 3 months,and therefore, cannot work.  See problem report."
3584532,HM stated AP is lovely and doing a great job.  Everyone is celebrating Jeremy's 10th bday.
3584531,Things are going well.  HM said that the kids are adjusting very well.  They all seem to like the new AP.
3584529,Jen is happy that they matched and are hoping Kris will find a nice family for her extension year. I thanked HM for referring a friend to APC.
3584526,Joha is doing a good job. HF had a question about traveling to Mexico. HF has not decided yet about their childcare options for next year
3584514,Most of the weekends have been free for the AP.  Right now she is at a class in Tampa with another AP.  AP does have meals with the family.  Sometimes she does go on outings with the family.
3584499,Everything is great and there are no changes. HF is likely going to get another AP and I advised her on the early match discount.
3584495,Everything is great. They will start their search very soon with an arrival goal of late April.
3584492,Iveth is providing a great childcare for HF. HM was concerned about Iveth as two of her friends went in rematch and that left Iveth uneasy and worried because she thought these HFs are unfair. I told HM there is always two sides of the story and that au pairs were not mistreated and that they were safe and in the rematch process.
3584491,Everything is great and they are already at their 19 month mark!
3584490,"HM shared with me she might have to let Ale go in March. She will not have her job after March and they are not sure if they will need Ale. HM said if Ale was absolutely great they would make it work but since she is not providing a very good childcare and they will not need her, most likely they will let her go. HM said she will speak to her husband and they will make a decision soon."
3584484,It's going well. Angie is now capable and comfortable with driving Christy to all of her doctor's appts and therapy appts. Christy has been experiencing seizures in the car lately so HM's mother has been riding with Angie just for safety purposes so that she won't get distracted with the seizure while she is on the road. HM says that Angie is great with Christy and they plan to ask her to extend with them!
3584475,HM stated AP is good but gets frustrated when she takes him on vacation with the family and when it is time to work he complains he's tired. HM is not taking him on family trip to Italy in the summer
3584473,HM stated everything is going good with AP and isn't going to renew because she doesn't have time to train an AP from another country at this point in her life.
3584469,Great.  HD is worried about AP as his grandfather died.  HD offered to pay for a flight home for AP and give him the time off.  AP declined the offer.
3584463,Very good.  HM is hoping AP will extend.  AP does a great job and is so pleasant
3584459,Good.  AP is very nice but forgetful.  HF is searching and interviewing for next AP
3584458,Everything is great with AP.  HM is actively looking for a new AP and considering male APs this year too
3584423,AD spoke with HM. Everything is going great. No complaints or concerns at this time.  AP told HM she wants to leave program early to start school in the fall in Sweden.  The HF has a really good relationship with the AP and HF feels the it would be best for everyone involved not to get in the way of AP's education.  HM wanted to know if they would get a credit for the unused months.  She also was concerned that AP's file would be viewed in a negative way for leaving early and offered to write a letter on AP's behalf.  HM stated AP is wonderful and great in every way.  AP has booked her flight for July 22 about 11 weeks before the end of her program year.
3584421,"Good. AP is great.   On another note HM is very disappointed that APC would not work with her to remove the IS designation for her next AP. HF picked this AP because she was a friend of one of their other AP's. HF knew that this AP was designated as IS. HF does not need this but thought it was something the AP wanted for her future. After speaking with the AP and the AP sais she didn't want it HM thought there was no reason to have it. HM tried o work this out with APC, since it is costing the HF money. HM spoke with Corporate and they said they can't change the policy. that the HM should not have picked an IS AP if they did not need it. HM said she didn't  mind paying for it, if AP wanted it BUT AP does not want it. AD told HM that AD would speak with the RM"
3584414,All is fine with Aya.  They have been happy with her.  Spoke also with host father regarding the re-matching process and that they are looking for another Japanese AP.
3584413,HM stated everything is going well.  HM in the car with HC because they are driving back from Vermont.  AP had a couple days off while they were traveling.  Last month HM was concerned about AP because they got a new dog and AP was spending a lot of time home with dog but HM stated they worked it out so AP is not doing much with dog anymore.
3584395,So great! HM bought AP and friend concert tickets for tonight to Imagine Dragons. HM said that AP is getting out and making friends. Their Disneyland vacation was so much fun and the HM is so happy that AP is there!
3584393,AD spoke with HM. Everything is going great. No complaints or concerns at this time.
3584390,Good. AP is doing great! HM asked what people did with letting the AP drive in bad weather when the car the AP uses is not good in bad weather. AD discussed the options with the HM.
3584368,"AD spoke to HM.  She is frustrated AP is not taking better care of their car.  She is upset AP often drives the car distances to see her friends, and puts a lot of miles and wear and tear on the car.  She is also upset AP has gotten into minor accidents in the car.  HF wants car to last for other APs.  HF has already talked to AP about it, but still feels AP is careless.  AD also spoke to AP about it, and reminded HM she can charge AP $250 per accident that AP has in the car."
3584360,"Everything is great and they want to start looking for their next au pair. His only negative is just being a ""guy"" around the house, but he tries hard and he's great. Host Parents are going on vacation this week and Carlos and the kids will be going to her parent's house."
3584344,"AD spoke with HM.  AP is in final last 2 months.  HM said her income varies a lot as a realtor, so they are still trying to figure out where they are financially before committing to another AP.  She will keep us posted."
3584335,"AD spoke with HD, who said they are all doing well, and that AP is doing fine.  He said he thought AP was at bookstore with the HC.  No issues."
3584330,"AD spoke to HD.  He and AP have decided to extend together for 1 year.  He said he has all of the extension info.  They are very excited.  He has a friend he would recommend to be an AD.  AD gave him RM's e-mail address, so she can send in her resume."
3584322,Fine.  They haven't been able to get the SSN or anything yet due to all of the closings from the snow storm and today being a Holiday.  Maybe Friday.  Looking for ESL courses and complained that they are too many hours in a day and difficult with scheduling.  Told her about NCSU new ones and Continuing Education Classes.  Went over again how to locate them.
3584314,"Very well, no complaints"
3584289,AD spoke to HM.  They are in the process of doing a pre-match.  Future AP is doing all of her paperwork to change over to APC.  HM said they didn't need anything on our end.
3584281,Heather says that this last few months have been going so fast.  She will miss Ana.  She shared with me some of the friend difficulties that Ana had with another au pair that I was unaware of.  Heather is hoping that she and the new au pair get along as well as she and Ana did.
3584278,HM says that Sabrina is adjusting nicely - she will attend AP get together later this week.
3584274,"Good. AP is good with the HC, sweet as can be and has made friends already so all is good!"
3584270,Everything is good with AP.
3584267,"Good. AP is considering extending and HF would LOVE her to. HM said AP is EVERYTHING they had hoped for in an AP., their previous AP was lovely but this AP is that and more and spends time with the HF. They lover her"
3584254,HM returned AD's call. Good. AP and HF are talking about extending. AP just finished her Education and will be filing the papers
3584217,Fine. Pearl left for two weeks to go to Thailand.
3584216,Going well. Nadja is stepping up her game for the last month. The new au pair will be coming soon.
3584215,going well.
3584214,Going well. They will miss Dani.
3584202,Going well. They are going to be extending.
3584193,"going very well, they are celebrating HC birthday with party on Sunday day of outing and it is also Sveni's b-day on the 8th. HM says she may need her to help clean up but she said if Sveni did attend maybe something could be done for her birthday!"
3584176,HM says they are good and just winding up Amy's time here. Looking forward to meeting the new AP.
3584173,"AP is adjusting extremely well to HF.   The snow days have been fun for family and given AP and HF a chance to ""connect"" HF is vey happy with AP"
3584172,"AP has adjusted well to HF.  HF and AP were snowed in for three days and ""everyone survived""!! HM is happy HF found an IC replacement."
3584167,Everything is going very well.  There have been no more issues with AP.  HM is still very pleased with the match.
3584165,"So far everything with the placement is great.  HM said that it has been an easy transition and everyone is happy and getting adjusted.  AP seems more mature than former AP, she seems like a good fit."
3584156,"Good, they are all really happy and it seems to be working out. Miranda's communication is clear and the kids like her alot too!"
3584154,well
3584148,HD reports that everything is great and they have no problems or issues. She is leaving soon and they are talking about a new AP but since his wife is on leave until June they would not get one until then.
3584147,"Good. Hymne is boy crazy again, lots of drama, broke up with boyfriend and with someone new now. She's been very dingy - car accident, left oven on in her appt one day, not answering calls or texts. It's frustrating but she does a good job with the kids."
3584146,HM & AP are good - are in Tahoe skiing - all are adjusting nicely to each other - AP will come to dinner on Thursday.
3584141,"Placement ends 2/14 per AP and HM mutual agreement (AP wants to leave, HM doesn't need the extra 2 days)."
3584139,Talked with HD about AP extending and sent her all the info again. No firm decision has been made.
3584126,Well.  The family is on vacation with their au pair.  They are visiting family in Texas and Minnesota.  The baby is growing and getting into a routine now which helps. They will be back in town 2/27.  HM tells me everything is going well.  Nothing new to report.
3584120,Amy continues to do well in her match. She said the boys love the snow and it is difficult to get them inside. She is thankful Patricia likes the snow too. No concerns at this time.
3584110,AD spoke with HM and HM said that things are pretty good with her AP.  HM has been at home pretty much everyday since her AP arrived due to a sciatic nerve problem therefore the AP has not really been alone with the children.  HM said hat the AP as driven some on her own and seems to be doing a good ob.  HM will probably let the AP tart driving the children o their activities in a  couple of weeks.  AP's social security card has arrived and hey will get her a banking account next week.
3584109,Per HM things are going very well with AP
3584101,AD spoke to HD he said Amy is great HD just getting impression she may be home sick. Amy didn't make as many friends yet and she's  home a lot. I told him she made some friends today at AuPair meeting he was happy to hear that. Last weekend HF took Amy to Virginia skiing .

3584097,AP is great and HF feels very lucky to have her. They are sad she has to go back early. Not sure what they will do next.
3584085,"All is going well. Spoke with HD, he is so pleased with AP. Says that they are so happy with Hana and now that time is drawing close to her completion he is afraid that no other AP can meet her high standards. HD had nothing but great things to say about AP and what a great fit she has been for Ava."
3584082,Everything is great! AD spoke with HM who stated AP has been with HF for over a year and AP is a wonderful asset to HF. HM stated she does not anticipate any issues at all.
3584066,HM says that everything is going smoothly and she has no complaints.
3584054,"Long talk with HM.   AP is going thru a difficult time with a crazy situation at home.  Uncle stole money from grandmother's fund, leaving the family almost 80,000 Euros in debt and so Julia and mom will bear responsibility.  HM reports that AP is stressed and crying a lot.  At the moment, AP is debating whether she should return and help her mother, though there is not much she can do.  HM is sympathetic, but a lot of this is being played out in front of the kids.  Crying all the time...  AP has not told me about this, so I will follow up tonight.  HM is willing to give this a few weeks to see if things improve, but is also willing to let her go if she cannot do her job and feels she ought to go home.  They really like AP and want her to stay."
3584053,Great!  Anny is in Mexico at the moment.  HF just referred a family -- DiTuri.  HM is back in selections but has not looked yet.  She knows she has time.  Thinks an early-July arrival.  All is good with Anny. She is very independent and they don't have to worry about her ever!
3584032,HM says that things are good with AP. She says that she is doing a really good job with the kids.
3584021,All is great with AP and they have not yet decided if they will get another AP in April.
3584020,Everything is really good and HF has no questions or concerns at this time.
3583998,"Nathaly:  Farah stated that she needed to reschedule orientation for 4pm.  She also stated that Nathaly's driving is in question.  They got her a driving lesson to help with the process and the teacher stated that she would need more time and work and was not ready to drive by herself.  I asked her to call the teacher to get an estimate of how long he thought it would take.  She asked if APC would cover the costs of lessons, I stated no, her AP stated that she was a full time driver and should be able to perform at that level ounce she got used to the car and the roads.  She stated that this could result in a match break for them if she is not capable of driving safely.  I stated that we wold speak about it at orientation and she would speak with Nathaly beforehand so that she understands what could happen.  Hada:  Hada is doing well.  She is helping with the training of the new AP and has been wth her in the car while she was driving.  Hada stated that her driving is very questionable."
3583989,all is well
3583973,"George and I emailed about some things, and then spoke over the phone. We talked about social sec. card, and the schools and i sent some information about that to them. George is also concerned that Erika's driving is not that good, and I explained how that is common at first and how quickly that can change. We also met as George dropped Erika off and he got introduced to some other AP's also. It was nice. We are having our meeting this week too."
3583969,"connected with Kate and she loves loves loves the AP, laura and says all is going great. They are a really really good match and seem to really enjoy one another's company and can talk and Kate is so grateful."
3583966,Great. HF is very nice.
3583959,"Very well, HF is thrilled with the AP and very happy to have her. They are sorry she is unable to extend. HM let AP know the family is moving to Hawaii this June and want to take AP with them so she can finish out her year. AD told HM that I would let APC know and make sure that would be ok."
3583958,"HM is not sure this match is going to work out.  HM sometimes need to work more than 45 hours per week and because AP's driving skills are not at a point where she can get her license, using day care as an additional resource is not currently an option because HM would have to drive the children to day care herself."
3583950,s/w HM everything good and no issues - gets along well w/kids - no issues w/schedule or pay - she is aware of event tomorrow and thinks AP is going to go
3583944,"HM says that mostly all is well until last night. When HM came home from dinner, AP had poured herself a glass of wine in her room. HM reminded her that there is no drinking on the job!!"
3583942,"HM Karlene said that everything is ""great."" HM said that she finally emailed me AP's extension papers and both HF and AP plan to extend for another year. HM said that AP Lucie has been great and is good about reminding eldest son Zach to practice his clarinet as well as being a big help with both boys overall."
3583913,All is going well. Spoke with HM and she is very happy with AP. She says that they couldn't have made a better match. AP is the best thing for the girls. The house is currently in a buzz as the twins 1 year birthday party is coming up. HM said that AP expressed she wants to extend for 9 months but they had told her that she needs to first obtain her driver's license and they need to be comfortable with her driving by the end of March before they can say yes to her extension. The twins will be involved with more activities and they require an AP with strong driving skills to drive them around.
3583910,"All is going well. Spoke with HD, says they have no issues or concerns. They are currently in the process of looking for a new AP as Theres will be going home soon."
3583899,"Conducted Apo. Both parties seem to be doing well. Ap had been in the US six years ago and is already aware of the culture. According to the hd, Danielle is a good driver. HF has a detailed job description for Danielle"
3583893,"HM rmc yesterday when I was away from the computer.  Everything is going great with Natalia, they couldn't be more pleased, she is so much a part of the family everything just flows.  They are in Wyoming for the long weekend and plan to ski."

Ali broke the cell phone they gave her and Mical ask Ali to pay to have it repaired. Ali refused so they took the ceel phone back and Ali is acting out. She hopes Ali will realize the phone is a perk and not a given.  Action=follow up with Ali and see what is going on.

3583820,Everything going well. Family is travelling to San Francisco with Au Pair.
3583814,Everything is going great as usual.
3583810,Lynn said things are fine.  They picked up the car.  The other driver says he doesn't remember the 2 hours prior or 3 hours after the accident so his insurance company is going to pay everything even though the photos show Kathy should be partially at fault.  Lynn also thinks they will pay any difference in the trade value since they just had the trade valued the day of the accident.  She thinks Kathy should have some repercussion but she hasn't talked about the deductible yet.  I will check and see if AP is still responsible if other party is found at fault.
3583739,It is absolutely wonderful.  She has cooked dinners for them  and they love the food.  The girls do whatever she tells them to do!  They are cooking with her too.  She is driving already and is doing well.

3583574,"Spoke with Veronica.  She isn't sure if she wants to extend with Lizbeth, but she has grown a lot in the short time she's been here.  She is leaning toward getting a new AP that better fits her families needs."
3583560,"Spoke with Sue and everything is going great,  Silja will be in Tahoe this weekend so won't make it to the Bowling Event."
3583556,"called to connect with Sarah who is really happy. Sarah says Adriana is great, she is working well and they love her. all is calm, she is great with the kids. Adriana has a ton of friends and is very busy all the time, she has a boy-friend and does a drumming class."
3583550,"Well.  I asked Holly how the Disney cruise went.  She said they enjoyed it but she wasn't sure that Laila liked it too much.  Holly said she seemed ""off""'.  Laila mentioned that she wouldn't do something like that again.  She's in NYC this weekend with Miriam.  HM isn't happy that she's getting back close to midnight on Sunday and told Laila so.  This is not the first time she's gone to NYC and come back late.  I suggested Holly sit her down and and ask her what's bothering her.  Holly feels she's pulling away a little bit.  Other than that things are going well.  HM is happy that Laila is making a friend.  To date she hasn't brought any au pairs home and really hasn't made any good friends."
3583545,Have contacted Amy and left messages so we did out contact via email and hopefully can speak this weekend. She has been very busy with work but loves Petra! all is great.
3583542,AD spoke with HM and HM says that her AP is doing good. AP will be traveling home to Costa Rica next month and HM hopes she has a good time seeing family and friends  HM said that she and her AP have talked about extending with each other and all of that sounds good to her so the will begin he paperwork next week.  AD asked HM about AP talking too much on telephone during work hours. HM said that she hasn't noticed that is a problem.  AD let HM know that another HD is addressing it with his AP because he is finding that his AP s talking to her AP about an hour a lf or more during her work hour and it is a concern for him.  D and HM decided to let the HD address it from his end and see if anything changes before we address it from our end since this HD and AP do no tlive in Memphis but in New Jersey.
3583530,"Very well.  Maria's english has been helpful in the process of her getting acclimated to the area and the family.  HM Kristin said she's doing well.  She's bonded better with the two older children which is different than Jana who bonded better with the two younger ones.  So far, so good."
3583523,"AD spoke with HM and HM said that her P is great.  HM told AD about a conversation that she had with her AP where the AP talked about me, AD, and how she loved that I really cared about the AP's and took the time to an fun event each moth because the AD for Cultural Care does not and the AP's are very frustrated by this. AD and HM also discussed the most recent HF applying to the program and ho she may help them a little bit with tips on how to interview potential AP's just as she di with the Vanderwalde HF.  HM explained to AD that with HF Vanderwalde had a difficult experience with ME Annika.  HF was interviewing an AP from Colombia and they really liked her and were ready to math with her when they spoke with ME Annika.  ME encouraged them to ass because, ""P's from Colombia are terrible driver's"".  AD expressed gratitude to HM Throckmorton for letting AD know about a difficulty that a HF had working with ME."
3583519,Very well.  The HF just got word that APC received their au pair's extension application and that it will be sent on to the DOS. I told Tony that it would be about two weeks before they hear it is approved. He had no questions or concerns.  He said everything is fine.

She is interested in female APs this time as her daughter is getting older. HM has been very busy and AP is very supportive. They will travel to Canada next week and I advised HM to ensure that AP doesn't need a visa.
3583478,It is great. AP is a much better fit and is good at giving the kids direction and having them listen to her. She is good at decision making and is much tidier. They are happy with her.
3583475,Hm called and said they were having a couple of issues with Ap. App is not very organized and keeps forgetting things Hc need. Hm has made a checklist and will have a conversation with Ap tonight. Hm said she is sweet and nice and they live having her. Ad mentioned rematch because it is coming up to the 6 month mark and Hm said they are not interested in that at this point they want to work with her. Ap recently found out that get aunt has terminal cancer. Ad will discuss with ap. Ap's sister is coming for a visit so Hm is hoping this will hel.

3583444,"Spoke with Dana. She said that things are going well with Charlotte. She had a car accident. It was minor. There was no damage to their car, but there was some damage to the other car. Charlotte has a new boyfriend. They feel that Charlotte can do better, but this he is nice. He lives in NJ and is a roofer. They had an issue this morning. Joe (the boyfriend) had stayed the night. The HF was not aware of this until this morning. Charlotte explained that they were out last evening and had trouble with his truck. They did not return home until 2am and he did not want to try and drive in the snow back to NJ. Charlotte said that he slept in the playroom and then moved into her room this am. The HF will talk with her. They are not comfortable with Joe spending the night and feel that she should have called them last evening if they were having trouble on the roads. Also, she should have called to let them know she would be home late as she is to be home by 11pm on worknights. Dana said that she is great in all ways. she is wonderful with the boys and is loving, fun and affectionate. She does a great job disciplining the boys. She has been smoking (she told them she was a social smoker before they matched but told them she would not allow the odor on her clothes.) She has come home several times smelling of cigarette smoke and the HF is not comfortable with this."
3583430,I spoke to Bren and she said things were going well.  She did have some questions about who pays for the gas for Alejandra when she goes to class.  I explained to her driving is a priviledge but if that is the way she prefers her to get to class she would need to make sure gas is in the car to get to and from class.  She said Alejandra was working on her school homework on her working hours and I told her she needed to talk to her about that.  I mentioned to her that again having the weekly meeting is very important as that gives them time to discuss the little things that can become big things.  She said Alejandra will be at the aupair meeting next weekend.  She thanked me for the call and I let her know I will be happy to help out in any way I can.
3583428,Better.  AP doing better with Silvio and using a chart seems to be helping.  AP is a nice girl and is very easy going.  Has a nice network of friends..  Is going to LIU next month.

They took her to urgent care and doctor said it was prolonged bronchitis because she hadn't been taking care of herself.  HM stated AP said to her ""thank goodness I had the pills last time."" HM said she didn't know what pills she was talking about.  AP also asked HM if she had any pills for PMS so HM bought her Midol.  AP seemed grateful but HM is genuinely concerned about AP's health.  When she asks AP, she states she feels fine but AP was coughing for 20 minutes.  AD suggested HM firmly state AP needs to see a doctor.  HM stated that she understands it can be intimidating trying to find a doctor in a foreign country.  AD stated that it is reasonable for HM to require AP to see a doctor and that she can help her find one.  HM stated she is also having trouble getting AP to take driver's test.  HF's insurance company says she needs to have her NJDL within 90 days of being in the country which has already passed.  HM has given AP deadlines and they have all passed.  AP states she is ready to take the test but has not gone to take it.  HM asked if AD would call Naledi and ask how she's feeling and discuss her health.  HM stated that they are going to have a meeting and sit down to discuss these issues because she wants to work them out themselves without help of AD.  AD encouraged HM to be very firm when she discusses issues with AP and asked HM to call AD after the meeting.  AD stated if the meeting is not successful HM, AP and AD should meet to try to work out these issues."

I told her to let me know if she needs anything.
3583125,"HM shared her upset re: the fact she had to hire a plumber for a back up she believes was due to the AP flushing wipes & grease down the drain.  Shared it cost her $500. to fix and feels it is a cost she should not have to incur.  Also shared that she doesnt feel the AP gives her children the developmental education needed to really support the cost she has invested in the program fee.  HM shared she has made lesson plans for her to follow but, doesnt feel she should have to do that.  Feels the agency should equip the AP's with this info and provide them with the resources they  need to be a value to families.  AD explained that request is very individual and that it really depends on the AP to follow thru wiith that.  HM feels we should hold them accountable to providing that kind of care.  AD shared that her ideas and thoughts would be presented to the RM.  HM also requested RM's email to discuss her concern surrounding the plumbing cost and requesting compensation.  Other than that feels that the AP is doing her job (more like a babysitter than an educator) and no other concerns."

I told her she should not send any more mail back to Germany.  She should let the au pair know it is still not resolved and that you are returning the mail to sender.  We talked about Meike too.  I gave her feedback and told her how great I think she is.  Karen said she's been great, especially since the weather has been so bad and the girls have been home a lot due to snow days."

3582854,Lynbrook schools closed today. Kids have no homeowork packets for the holiday week. Father is taking the kids t/w/th skiing at MT Creek. Hmom and AP hate snow + shoveling. AP off Friday+ Saturday.
3582847,"well. HF and AP very happy together. AP is wonderful with the girls . H son having a hard time but it could be his age. HF when they leave the house they are ""not worried"". AP is very social going to NYC + the movies. AP engages with the HF nicely."

3582798,"AP and HF had a heated conversation yesterday about the international drivers permit and the AP getting a NYS license and failing the road test. HF feels the AP has not given them all the information and was not honest about getting the right paper and AP feels she did tell the HF her international permit had expired and that her parents were trying to get a new one, but she was dishonest about saying when she is getting it and regrets that. HF and AP discussed ending the match. AD is following up and also sent info on international permit in USA. AP has booked all her tickets for travel at the end of her year."
3582791,Jennifer says Bea is doing a great job and they no issues!
3582788,Nancy says Gaby has been a big help. They are definitely having a much nicer experience than before. She is not  really interested at this time for extending as this was a short term situation.

3582739,"s/w HD - states things are ok for now - AP just left to go back to Australia for her sister's wedding - he does not foresee any issues with her return - asked about next program year as they are up in June - said they are not sure what they are going to do - they think that after the AP goes back home, it will make her not want to extend, but really does not know at this time - adv that if she is serious about extension, needs to finish her education requirement - adv if anything needed, please let me know - he did ask about the vacation time - i adv 10 hours per program year starting in 3rd month"
3582737,s/w HM - everything going great and no issues - she confirmed they got all the tax documents and she s/w her dad who is an accountant - no issues at this time

3582731,well
3582730,well
3582718,The HF has been happy with how the placement has ended with Mica.  They are considering host two in country au pairs.  The HF recently found out they are expecting a sixth child and feel having two au pairs would be best.
3582680,All great with Annika. Working on filing taxes with accountant. HM had couple questions about new ap. Planning on going away with her to Jamaica as soon as new ap arrives so just wanted to make sure her papers would be in order. I said ds form will be signed for international travel. Scheduled in oi since they will be away for 10 days.
3582679,Excellent
3582662,Spoke with Liz. She said that things are great with Diana. The girls had a snow day today and may have another tomorrow. The girls love her!!
3582655,"HM Juliet expressed concern that new AP Verena's shyness ""is keeping her from connecting with the children. In our particular case, it is imperative that our au pair speak freely in our house at all times.""  HM said that she is encouraging AP Verena ""as best we can. Both Lucy and Carter need ongoing verbal engagement - it is a mandatory.""  I gave HM Juliet a few suggestions e.g. having AP Verena call her 2x daily to check in during the day as well as sitting down every night to review the day as well as to compare notes.  I also suggested that departing AP Sami let new AP Verena take the lead. I told HM that I would continue to check in on both HF and AP but that AP told me that she was happy and felt comfortable."
3582654,"HD says that AP is doing exceedingly well. They all had colds, but otherwise are all doing fine."
3582653,"Vivan  has  received the newsletters, but not the tax information. So I resent that to her. Everything is fine. Kara & Sabrina are making the best of enjoying the snow..."

3582635,Spoke with Amira. She said that things are going well with Maria. she said that Noa has been really tough and is really testing her but Maria is handling it well. She said that they were all home today b/c of the snow storm.
3582628,"It is okay. AP is really absent minded and HF has dealt with it because they like her and don't want to be petty, but it gets frustrating sometimes. They are not happy with the candidate pool and are trying to decide if they will get another AP next year."
3582614,Very well- The girls love Gaelle and are getting to know Nora.  Gaelle will be traveling soon.
3582603,The HM reported everything is okay so far.  The HM is concerned because the AP is becoming friends with the last AP's friend from El Salvador.  The HM hopes the AP will make friends with non-Spanish speaking AP's.  The APO is scheduled for this Sunday at noon.
3582601,All is well. AP is great and HM is anticipating a bit of senioritis in the upcoming months. I told her not to worry that things usually go really well towards the end. They are excited for their new AP and I let HM know that we have many CR Aps at the moment.
3582598,Ulrik says Anne is a huge help!
3582591,"HM is settling in and enjoying the warmer weather in Texas.  AD let her know that the AP had nothing but praises for the HF at the Valentine's Party, and the HM's feelings were mutual, that she thinks she's hit a jackpot with this AP.  AD also had a pleasure of meeting the HD in person and catching up with him while dropping off the AP after the Valentine's Party on Feb 9.  He's happy to be reunited with the family after a long 20+ of driving from New Jersey.  HD is very happy for the AP to be making new friends."
3582586,"It is going okay. It's not the same as having Chris with them and I encouraged HM to understand that it can be hard for a bit having a new person and give it some time. Everyone in the family has been really sick, including AP, but she was a trooper and HM appreciated her not complaining and having a good attitude about it."
3582585,"HM states everything is going very well. Everybody happy! HM also said they have decided to continue in the APC program for another 2 years. They had thought about other possibilities, but decided to stay with APC."
3582560,Everything is great. AP went and did the weekendprogram class last weekend and got a bunch of credits done and some travelling. She has family coming in April and will travel with them a bit as well.
3582546,Everything is the same. Nothing new.
3582544,"HM called AD for question about AP's taxes.  The AD sent an email over to the HM and directed her to the APC document which is the ""AP Tax Cheat Sheet.""  HM also reported that she is having a second child due in August."
3582538,"HM has no complaints. Existing AP getting ready to leave and new one seems to be doing well so far. She has driven around with her and is waiting for her to be here two weeks so she can get her SS card, then bank acct, and drivers license. so far, no complaints."
3582537,"Jenny reports that everything is going smooth, no concerns. Sabrina is in Canada(Toronto) for a Justin Timberlake's concert."

3582532,It is going really well. HF is at Disneyland at the moment and AP is also in California but taking some vacation time and travelling with her mom and sister.
3582525,well
3582524,"talked with Joel, things are good, everyone is fine and all rules are being followed, tired from shoveling the heavy snow... will talk again next month"

3582458,Spoke with Betsy. She said that things are going great with Leila. They absolutely love her and she is terrific with the kids. The kitchen rehabilitation is coming along but not quite finished.
3582455,well
3582441,HM says the placement is going very well.
3582425,"Katy says,All is well.  Franzy wasn't feeling well on Sunday, so she didn't make the meeting, but she's feeling better now.  She had the same cold that  the family had.  No fun, but nothing serious.  Katy has  been getting the newsletters, and Franzy's taxes are all done."
3582416,Summer says Lena is great! She will join us at the meeting  and go snowtubing. We spoke about reapplying and starting the search again.
3582410,"Erica says,All is well there. Line's family arrives tonight and they are off for Feb break while Line and family stay in Boston. They have gotten the newsletters and are doing well."
3582398,"all good, spoke with Hay, the children are good and things are great with Kat, all rules are being followed and no questions, know how to reach me if they need anything"
3582396,"Hmom reports that all is well with AP Jessy, that she has been so patient during their construction of finishing off the basement.  Hmom really appreciates Jessy's patience with it all and putting up with the noise and inconvenience.  AP informed Hmom that she will need to return home the end of June or beginning of July to enroll and finish up her degree at the university. Hmom asked how this would impact them.  I explained to hmom the 2 scenarios and how each would impact both them and AP.  Scenario 1) they could sign our early departure approval letter forfeiting any credit due to them for the unused months of childcare they would not be receiving from AP.  And by doing so, it allows AP Jessy to still receive her Comp. Cert. along with flight home paid by APC.  Scenario 2) By not signing the early departure approval letter, they would be entitled to receive a $500 credit per unused month of service and to apply it towards next program year.  But, AP would have to pay her own way home and would not rec. her Comp. Cert.   I suggested to Hmom that they calculate which of the 2 scenarios would be less of a financial burden to them.  Hmom was disappointed that APC would not make an exception by giving them a credit along with paying for APs flt. home.  I reminded Hmom that AP signed a contract saying she would provide childcare for a full year and that with breaking this contract comes consequences, that it is APs decision to break contract not APC's."
3582392,"things aren't great, Nathalye is disconnected from them which may be what she wants, her driving is good but only gets chores done sporadically, I offered to speak to her and if necessary we can make a change as I want them to have a good year and a positive experience with the  program... not now, but will discuss and may want to make changes later in the year, now she knows the routine and they don't want to deal with a new person getting used to the routine with school"
3582377,They are doing fantastic as always.  HP just completed another 1/2 marathon and the kids and AP were there to cheer them on every step of the way.  They also just celebrated Ian's 17th birthday.  Hard to believe how fast times goes.
3582373,"They are doing very well.  There have been no questions or issue, just kids being sick!  All is good in their home."
3582357,"HM had to insist that AP wasn't going to take the car out in the winter advisory days that we had in TX. AP just didn't feel it was dangerous and wanted to go. Considering the amount of damages AP has done to the car, HM had good reason to deny her request."
3582344,They're all doing fine. She thanked me for the newsletter. Klaus reviewed Jana's return yesterday and she sent it off today!  They can't believe she's been with us more than half a year already..
3582329,Lily said that things have improved and they are doing pretty well. Lily feels that she has relaxed a bit regarding keeping everything in its place at home and expecting Clarissa to be so proactive with picking things up all the time.
3582312,Alex said everything is great with Irina. We discussed that she can reapply for her new program year now and start looking au pair candidates for summer arrival.
3582304,HM says all is still going fine. No problems to report.
3582301,HF is very happy with AP.  HF had hoped AP would extend for one more year but HM thinks AP wants to return home and begin school in July.  Hm will get confirmation from AP by end of month.  If AP not extending than HF will begin search for new AP in March
3582300,I spoke with Abdul after he had a conversation with Myra - we talked about making sure that Myra is getting out of the house enough as she feels quite isolated with the snow storms and not going out in the car.  I told him that I had spoken with Myra about having a driving assessment and that they would come and take her for a test drive so she can see what she needs to practice on.  He agreed and said that there are cars there that she can drive once she becomes confident.  I told him that the issues she had with Saadi seemed to have been resolved and he told me that he spoke with the HM about the lunch and who was to pay for it as Myra was confused as she thought she was working but HM said she was just being kind and asking if the AP wanted to join them as they were all going out.   Abdul told me that Myra had said she did not know if she would be able to stay the whole time and I let him know that she had not spoken with me about that  I think that when she gets access to the car and gets to go to school she will have a better outlook on the length of time she will stay.
3582292,HF is enjoying snow day at home.  AP is in Mexico for the week visiting family.  Hm said AP was delayed in Dallas for one night due to weather but arrived safely to Mexico.  Hm is very pleased with AP Happy to have an extension year
3582287,Spoke with Michal and Dallas when I went to pikc up Liz to take her to the mini-meeting on Friday - they invited me in and we had a nice talk.  Things are going well and they are very impressed with how well Liz can keep the children on a schedule and sleeping through the night etc.
3582281,"Good, kids taking a little longer to adjust though so worked with Aroa on different strategies for working with them and discipline. Also more bonding time. AP has made some ap friends too."
3582279,"Susan said that things are going well and that they were all very happy when Monika got her 6 month extension.  She is going to take her DL and I told Susan I would help her to know what she is required to do for the test as it can be difficult with the handsignals, parallel parking etc."
3582272,HF and AP are enjoying the snow day.  HM said it took her three hours to get home last night.  AP is wonderful.  HM says AP enjoys spending time with HF and is eating dinner with HF almost every night of the week.  Hm is extremely pleased with this childcare option
3582270,Things are going well and Miren is doing a great job - she loved the meeting last week and had a great time with her friends doing that.
3582269,Kate said all is going well this month with Paola.
3582242,"Placement is going well.  AP is signed up for 2 classes, but the one was delayed because of the snow.  AP doesn't haven any concerns or problems."
3582223,"HF is doing very well with AP, Maiara is doing great and family is considering extending another 6 months with her.  AP is currently in Brazil and talking to her family to see if it is okay to extend.  HF will know by end of month if yes or no."
3582207,"All is going very well. Spoke to HD, Hm is in Singapore and will be back tomorrow from her meetings.  HD stated all was going very well."
3582205,AP is doing great as usual.
3582201,"All is going very well. Spoke with Jack, he told me he put in the extension application, but AD called Scott and none was received.  AP then called HD back and had to leave a message stating that extension application was not received on line asking family to resubmit one more time."
3582159,"All is going very well with Andy. HM is stuck in the city in meetings today and was there for the past few days, is missing out on all the snow."
3582155,HM really likes AP and feels like she is a great match.  AP is very relaxed and fits very well into the HF.  HM is very tired because everyone has been sick in the house and she is exhausted but everyone is home due to the snow day.
3582154,"All is going very well with Jasmin.  HM is home with the kids as HD is in Florida on business.  No issues at all with Jasmin, she is great.  HM asked if the Freeley's applied and if her name was there as the referral and it is."
3582141,Everything is going great. The family feels like the Au Pair is the perfect fit for their family.
3582117,things are going well - they will all be happy when the snow stops as it has been one storm after another.  I spoke with Mary about the DL and what Fernanda would have to have to get the license.  Everything is great and she was glad that she got the extension approval so quickly
3582110,HD says AP is doing great!  AP is going to Hawaii in March.
3582109,"Things are going well.  HM had no major concerns.  They celebrated the AP's birthday last week and appreciated being in each other's lives.  On Weds, AP takes the HC to a local church for knitting/playtime so the HM can devote the morning to baking.  The bakery is still on hold, so she takes custom orders and works out of the home for now.  AD let her know that her cookies were a huge hit at the Valentine's Party."
3582106,"Things are good, Silvi is struggling with a lot of homesickness though, and hm wanted advice as to how to handle it.  Previous ap was never homesick so they didn't have this struggle.  Asked hm if ok to bring up to ap that she mentioned she's been sad and hm said yes, she'll tell her she mentioned it to me.  Advised hm to have ap contact me for help as well."
3582097,Very well.
3582090,"Well.  AP has had some attitude issues when she was inconvenienced due to a fire at the HF's yoga studio.  AP had to wait in car for a hour while HF left from dinner and met firemen at the studio.  AP also showed some discontent when HC went to her and asked for a drink when AP was off of work.  HD was getting gas in APs car because of impending snow storm, so HM was home alone w/ all 3 HC.  HM talked w/ AP about being a part of the family and ""going w/ the flow"" sometimes.  HM said she would not take advantage of AP and would not ask for her help during her off hours, but if it occasionally came up, that the AP not have attitude about it.  AP seemed to understand according to HM.  HM is respectful of APs time off in general."
3582083,Everything is great!  HM doesn't know what else to say!  Cassie is just the best! Reminded hm not to have Cassie start school until after 4/15.
3582081,Very well.  HM went over extending and dates for matching if choosing a new AP.  AD emailed 2014 matching and arrival dates.
3582078,"All is going very well with Amanda.  AD spoke to HD as he was working from home today due to all the snow.  Wishes he were in the office though, it's crazy at home."
3582076,"HM reported that things are going well and that there was no major concerns.  Both APs are enrolled in the weekend class in New Orleans in Apr, and HM is arranging for her friend to pick up the girls from the bus station and take them to the hotel.  They'll still need about 20 credit hours to satisfy the DoS requirements, so AD suggested another weekend class in Ft Worth in June and the ongoing Sat classes in Houston.  HM will review their offerings with the AP.  HD returns from China on Mar 9 and resume practicing driving with the APs."
3582075,Gaelle is doing well. She is preparing for her wedding and can sometimes be a little preoccupied. But the HF will miss her
3582067,Per HM sorry she didn't get back to me right away she's out of town.  Cata is wonderful!  Every day she makes HF life easier and they are just thrilled to have her.  She'll be starting another class at New America college when she gets home from vacation and she's super excited about it.
3582060,"All is going very well.  HD left AD a message stating there was really nothing to report.  AP is taking classes on weekends in the city and loves them, is great with the kid and no issues elsewhere."
3582049,"Things are going okay.  Little issues, such as being clean and neat and tidy, how to clean bathroom, etc, not dropping clothes all over the place.  Also, he drove with someone in the car and did not tell the family, and that is a rule, also had some issues with Gavin, the oldest, and AP did not respond properly, rather he told the child that the child had issues.  But family is working through the issues.  AP needs to stay on top of schedule and do it and not ask every day."
3582042,"All is great with Dudu, really no issues at all, she is just fabulous, really no issues"
3582039,"Advised HM of refund exception, she was very pleased.  Everything is going pretty well with Monika, there are a few things they could talk to her about like getting off the cell a bit and spending more fun time with the boys, but overall they are in good shape."
3582035,everything is good. AP is extremely helpful. H dad home today due to the weather. He was going out to shovel. H dad will tell AP event canceled and rescheduled to the 27th .

3581943,"Everything is great!  They are all doing well, we're going to try and get this DMV thing resolved, she'll have Anna call and see what they can do and if no help, then we'll see if Scott can help us. They are very excited about Angelika, advised hm be sure to stay in touch a lot as they've matched 6 mos out."
3581919,Bara is doing well. She just got back from vacation and the kids are adjusting to having her back
3581916,"Everything is great, no worries, concerns or questions per hm.  AP just got her new insurance card so they haven't scheduled the tonsillectomy yet, when they do, hm will let me know."
3581883,"Spoke at length with Teresa. They talked at length with Bruna and have tentatively decided to try and move forward with the match. They provided Bruna a list of house rules and asked her to agree to them. (House rules included spending some time with HF, no friends over while working, work 45 hours each week,) Teresa said that Bruna's response was not what they had hoped to hear. Bruna stated ""my life is my life and I will do what I want to do."" Teresa said that she has not spoken much since their meeting. She also asked again about her options. Discussed options with her."
3581879,HM says that AP has really adjusted well. She says that they are all doing well. HM says that she is concerned about the hospital bills from AP's fall and says that UNC doesn't want to cover the costs. SHe says that she will be back in touch with them to figure out why this is the case.
3581862,"Everything is great, Chelsea has been having a few issues with new friends cancelling plans at the last minute and hm worries a bit about her being lonely, but she keeps trying and that's what counts. Advised hm she was at last coffee night and that's the best way to meet new au pairs and get to know them better. Also reminded hm monthly events are good ways to stay focused and find new friends."
3581856,"Everything is wonderful, Midi is just the best ever, hf is super happy and has no questions or concerns.  Thanked hm for being on my reference list, advised her I've sent that out to several hf's this past week, she replied, no problem, happy to bolster the program!"
3581825,HM says that she absolutely adores AP and thinks that she will be financially OK to keep him until the end of his program.
3581762,Good right now.
3581758,"HM says AP is a good fit. They are determining needs for next year to see if they want to extend with Marilia.  AD went over ext app process, April 1 deadline and fees for extending vs. OS AP."
3581755,Good
3581748,Corrie is doing great. She is bright and really easygoing. The hF is already hoping she will stay for another year.
3581739,HF is home due to the weather. HF had a problem with the bathroom. Problem with the sewage. HF exhausted. Things are better with AP. HF going skiing Thursday- Sun. AP home while HF is away. AP not going thru their homework folder. AP missed that kids had a test in History.
3581725,"HM had no concerns or issues to report.  Things are generally good and HM considers the AP as one of her girls.  AD and HM spent most of our time talking about the program in general and what her plans are moving forward.  They'll most likely not continue with the program after the current contract ends in May.  AP will return home then and the HM plans to hire a live-out nanny who is much older and more responsible.  She feels that the AP program is too restricted with so many guidelines to follow.  She also believes the APs are generally too young and more concerned about social outlets then actually working as a nanny.  AD explained that it's not always the case that the APs are into clubbing and nightlife (as she's seen in the current AP) and that we have a wide pool of APs to choose one that's more family-oriented and conservative if that's what she'd like, and that we're always encouraging them to have a good balance of work, education, play as part of the whole cultural exchange.  At this point, the HM is pretty set on leaving the program in May."
3581708,Great.
3581706,It is going well. They speak often and discuss problems and concerns. HF may move to another country in the summer but will find out in the next weeks.
3581701,Good
3581696,Good

3581682,Good
3581680,Good
3581679,everything is good. H mom home due to weather. HF + AP home this vacation. HF will maybe go skiing one day this weekend. AP happy with all the other au pairs in the neighborhood.
3581671,Well - going on a trip to FL this week w/ Misa - all is going well.  No concerns at this time.
3581668,Good

3581655,Good
3581652,Things are going well.  HM had questions on the extension process and time frame for making that decision.  Right now HM is interested in a 6 month extension.
3581643,"AD called HD to tell him AP had matched and that new HF would pick up AP on Saturday 2/15.  HD was upset because he had asked for AP to stay until 3/1 because new AP couldn't arrive until 3/1.  AD said request had been received to change AP's availability date but AP was in the process of interviewing with HF and if none of them matched with her, APC would have changed her date, but one of them did match with her while her availibility date was still 2/15.  HD was furious, threatened legal action, etc.  HD can be extremely argumentative and abusive and AD has learned to hear him out,let him blow off steam, but stand her ground and eventually he calms down and we all move forward."
3581642,"HM Melissa said that,""All is well on our end. Vanessa and the kids are doing great.. We are all a little sick and tired of this brutal weather, kind of makes the kids a bit stir crazy."" HM said that they are moving to Marblehead, MA in June. I told HM that I would contact my counterpart AD there closer to June to let her know about HM and AP's arrival."
3581641,Good
3581638,"HM Jen said told me that, ""Things are going really well."" She is pleased that AP Kate is happy and both HM and AP commented how big the twin girls have become.

They may wait until after move but depending on needs may have to have new AP arrive while still in Houston. No preference with language or nationality. They want an AP who is a good personality fit and experienced with children.
3581431,"HF and AP are adjusting to each other, AP arrived last Thursday. HF had some questions about the $10,000 insurance minimum and AD will provide information from HF agreement and handbook in an email."

Rebecca isn't keeping with the spirit of the program but I keep reminding her that it is so important to help Maja feel comfortable being there in her free time.

They have been going nonstop with the visa issue and her having to fly back last weekend to take care of that and now they are all going to Arizona tomorrow through Tuesday for vacation.

I let him know that I'd spoken with Anien about it and sent her the extension info she needs.  We also talked about Luisa.  He said she is having a hard time getting the driving down.

3580528,"Everything is going great with Alex, she has been unable to get confirmation that her flight training will be grandfathered in so hf will move ahead looking for their next au pair.  Advised HM March 31st is the cut off for the May extension so if she hears before they match, they can still change their minds.

3580430,2 weeks HM starts radiation.  AP is doing really well.
3580418,"Jaime reports that things are going very well. Bela is doing a much better job of asserting herself over the children, they are behaving better and even bonding with her better. Little Lauren (the 4 year old) has taken to sleeping with Bela in her bed at night, and HM reports that this is a sign that she feels safe and secure w/Bela. She says that the oldest one (8 year old named Olivia) still has not warmed up to Bela yet, but she says that the 8 year old is going through a hard time right now as HD is deployed and she misses him very much.

HF shared she is doing well with the kids, they like her and they built a good relationship but HF feels Jenni's priorities are not kids. HF shared she often does not ask for the car or if she can have a guest over. She just tells them she will be taking a car or someone will be staying the night. I suggested to HF to visit them and have a meeting with AP. HF said they would meet with Jenni alone and will keep me posted. HF also shared that Jenni watches TV or is on computer during work hours."
3580332,"HM Suzie called to ask for the last working day for Laura. I let her know that 3-18 is the day she can move to another HF but if they wish earlier release and a HF wants her earlier they can arrange that. It is up to them but they cannot release her any later than 18th, just earlier."

She did bring up a concern that Conny seems to have built a bit of a wall between her and the boys and they feel that sometimes Conny can be sarcastic. I gave Tracy some great tips of how to talk to Conny about strengthening her relationship with the boys. She isn't very tactile with them. She plays games with them and is great with that but doesn't often give them a hug and she thinks that especially her older son needs a bit of that right now. Conny has had some social issues since she got here. She has trouble keep au pair friends and is socially awkward. Tracy will talk to her and seemed to appreciate the advice I shared with her."

3580099,"Things are great with Franzi. HM stated that the only issue is sometimes AP inserts herself where she shouldn't (when it should be something the HM or HD should address). They are working on that with her, but everything else is so good they are taking this issue in stride."

3579901,"Good,better. Seems hat Maria is spending less time with the boyfriend. Since the H and AP spoke things have gotten better. AP goes to school 2 nights and works out 3 nights starting at 4;30 an wants every weekend off. Hf is working with her but will start requesting more of her after they return from vacation on the 21st. HF requested AP to take vacation next week as they are leaving for a week.

He will talk with her about the issues. His sister is visiting and reported some things to him. The house is a mess. She has not been cleaning up after meals and after the kids. He said the kids dishes are in the sink and not taken care of. Also, he has come home during the day, she is gone with the car. He has instructed her not to use the car except for short errands and for the kids. He said he saw his car in the neighborhood at someone else's neighborhood and is wondering if she is working for someone else. He is suspicious but does not know for sure. He called her yesterday after his sister told him that Lina asked her sister to do the kids' laundry. She also keeps forgetting to turn the stove off. He has found the stove left on 4 times. He is very concerned. He said that he likes her and the kids like her but she must make the kids a priority. He will talk with her tonight or tomorrow. She also forgot to pick Joshua up at the bus the other day. His neighbor called to tell him. He called Lina and was not able to reach her. He finally reached Lina and she said she found him. He talked with her and she said it will never happen again. He said that she took the car to go to church. She left at 10:30 but didn't return home until 3:30pm. He felt that she was doing things after church with friends. The kids complained that Lina hasn't been feeding the kids. (She tells them they can't eat something and then she eats it herself.) Erle's sister is visiting (she has cancer and is receiving treatment here) and Lina asked her to do the laundry and to cook for the kids. She also put food in the oven and then left the house."

3579780,"HF hosted our Feb event, Valentine's Party.  AD and HM met privately before the party to discuss how things are going.  It was quite evident at the party how happy the HM and the HC are with the AP.  They've looked at the weekend class option and decided on the Chicago class.  AD let HM know that when she travels out of town and leaves the HC alone with the AP, then even the sleep time at nights are counted as work time as there is no other adult in the house.  HM is a regional manager and travels quite a bit but will try to limit them to day trips."

3579696,HF + AP going Thursday to Mexico. H mom trying to get everything done before departing. AP + HF excited for Mexico. Junes Father is improving.
3579666,HF is doing great with AP and have no questions or complaints. We have worked to gehter to help find advanced English courses that fit into her schedule. It has been quite hard to work out but seems she is doing it.. some of her courses did not make due to not enough people signing up.
3579663,Aurore is doing well.  The HF is happy with the job she's doing with the baby.  She didn't come to tubing because her ride got canceled.  She is practicing driving with her HP.  No issues with the job she's doing.  Jeff said she is a happy girl and has made a few friends already.  She keeps good notes on how the baby does all day which is nice.
3579647,Hm says all is well. She is happy to see Ingrid getting so calls and close to matching. HF has loved the AP program but will not get a replacement as children are older and no longer need full time care. HM said she would have liked to see  Ingrid's English improve more .. it might help with her rematching. No problems.
3579646,"They are all doing very well. HP travel a lot. HM just landed back in town today, and HD leaves today, but they have a system all worked out and Nane is great with the kids."
3579635,"Nicole received my email and called me right away.  She said that she didn't see the 53 hours that I was seeing, but we started looking at each day and she said that I was counting ""family hours"" as part of her work hours.  She said that Cristina told her that it was okay to include Paula in their dinner hours and have her included as ""family time."" I explained to Nicole that they should welcome Paula to have dinner with them, but they should not require her to.   Those two hours are her free time; she should be able to do whatever she likes during those hours; read, go for a walk, Skype with her friends, etc.  If she is required to work and be with the family, then those are part of her work hours.  I explained that if Paula chooses to eat with them, then she should act like a member of the family and help prep dinner, but if she is required to be at dinner, that needs to be counted as her work hours. Same with any chore that she is required to do for the family. If she is waking up to prep breakfast or empty the dishwasher, that time needs to be included in her work hours. If she is doing her own personal tasks, that does NOT need to be counted in her hours.  Nicole understood and promised to change the schedule pronto and send it back to me.     I asked Nicole how things were going with Paula in general, and she said that Paula is silent and that is not a good fit with their family. They want Paula to actively engage with the kids, but she is more apt to just maintain/watch them and make sure they don't get hurt. But, she is not talking to them unless prodded, which is problematic. The family wants her to talk Spanish with the kids, and I recommended that Paula say something in English and then in Spanish.  Nicole stated that that is what she has been instructing Paula to do, but Paula is not confident that the kids will learn Spanish while in her care, which is concerning to Nicole."
3579626,"Fine.  Jennifer called me to ask about paying for parking fees at NOVA.  I told her that host families are required to pay for their au pair to get to their classes so if they drive and need to park at school then the parking fee should be covered.  I told her she could choose to drive her and drop her off and the pick her up to save the $90.  I also told her that some au pairs share the drive and the cost of parking if they can.  Veri doesn't know anyone else going to NOVA at the same time though.  She also asked about the cost of the textbook.  The class cost $430 and the book cost $70.  I told her that though the HFA doesn't explicitly say textbooks should be included, the HF is responsible for up to $500 of education costs and that they should give Veri the $500."
3579615,I spoke with Mahmood who said everything is going well with Jessica although Jessica has had some stomach issues lately and needs to see a doctor so I recommended that they contact United healthcare to be sure that the doctor that they visit is considered to be in network.

3579498,"Everything is going well. Sarah states that Melanie was upset at first when they found a new AP, but now that she's applied for extension she's excited and okay. Sarah states that Melanie's last day of official paid work will be March 28, so they would like Melanie's first available date to be March 28;however, they are willing to work with Melanie and let her stay with them if she cannot join her new HF until a bit later, or if she has to leave earlier they will accomodate her schedule. Sarah stresses that she wants Melanie to know she has a place to stay if there is a period of time where she's in transition between two host families."
3579484,"Calls,e mail to HM all is well, she is delightful"
3579444,Michelle reports that everything is going fine. They are very excited that Simona has extended with them for another year!
3579441,HD said that they have hit their stride and things are going fantastic.  AP is doing a wonderful job and they couldn't be happier.  They are hoping that it was just an adjustment period that she went through in the beginning and they are hopeful that they will have a great year.
3579422,Teresa called me back. She let me know all is going well with Yenny. Thanked me for my call.

3579380,"angela is pleased with her match with celina.  they are in agreement with working as a team with the triplets and are reviewing love and logic principals together.  they have discussed school, vacation, rules, etc.  They seem to engage very well with one another and celina is thrilled to be here."

3579348,very good. AP is settling in and so far all is good.
3579337,"The HM called the AD to express concerns about the AP not doing the simple things they've asked her to do such as keep the kitchen tidy and load/unload the dishwasher. She also does not feel the AP is even attempting to bond with the kids. She is very frustrated, but has agreed that she needs to have a serious talk with her and give her the benefit of the doubt."
3579271,I spoke with Marya.   She said all is great with Jia.   She thinks that she is happy and they are happy with her. Didn't have any questions for me.

3579261,Things are going well.  HM said that she does not think there are any major issues but several things have concerned her.  AP was resistant to get her SSC but finally did register.  She was disappointed that all of the classes she wanted to take started at 6pm but the HM already told her she could not do that since she'd always be late to class.  AP does not wish to open a bank account but has not explained why.  AP has off during the days and HM feels it's been hard for the AP to get things done on a personal level not with her job.  HM is just concerned about her motivation.  AP is still not unpacked and currently living out of her suitcases.  HM does plan to take the AP out to explain the parking meters and what to look for.
3579259,"Things are not going so well, see problem report.  HF would like a rematch"
3579247,"Great.  Things are going well. Since HM and girls all have different weeks off for winter break, not going away."

3579183,"Well.  AP is doing well.  Saori is a hard act to follow, but HF really likes Mai. HF has had a tough winter with colds and flu and had to cancel trip to Florida. HM works MWF."
3579176,Very well. AP is doing a good job and the girls are happy. AP is good friends with Sonja from Germany. HM was away for a week for work but it all went well.

3579115,"things are going very well, Hm can't believe she needs to start looking for a new AP ans will start the search soon."
3579104,"AD confirmed with HD Rob that things are ending smoothly with Thais.  He helped her prepare her taxes, and we talked about his getting the smartphone back to give to next AP.  Rob said that Thais continues to do a good job, and they will all miss her, but they look forward to meeting their next AP, as well."
3579099,"HM and AD discussed vacation days, and HM said that AP Julia is ""really excellent"" and a big help.  HM is ""negotiating to get back in my house"", and once that is settled, HM will let AD know.  She expects it to be  a very short time."
3579092,"Well.  She is excited about the arrival of Dani also, but Anna is great.  Sent a referral Robbie Howell and the AP of the month write up after we spoke. *Called again 2/21 and finally caught her 2/24: She asked about moving Anna to a new room so she and Dani will have similar spaces.  Anna is in the big room with a balcony and she is moving Howie's office and Kyra's nursery into the big room and using those two rooms with the adjoining bathroom for Anna and Dani. Anna was cool with it and Autumn wanted to make sure she wasn't breaking a rule by changing her from what she promised in the interviews."
3579060,Spoke with HM this morning. She is quite upset with Ap Viviana as she has decided to extend for 12 months with another hfs in SF that goes to the same school as they attend. HM feels offended and is considering breaking the match early with Viviana. We talked about but ultimately is the HF's decision. HM will go back into selection to look at new candidates.
3579032,"HM Laurie told me, ""Everything is going very well.  Vivien and I have got our routine down and she's been a huge help."" HF is taking AP to CA with them for a family vacation next week."
3579029,"Tonight is Isabela's last night with the family. She is so filled with emotion., but is ready to go home and start her next phase.  Last Friday night they all went out for a going away dinner and had a couple of AP's friends to the dinner as well."
3579026,"HD said that they are ready to have the house back to themselves again.  They have learned a lot about living with others and are appreciative that AP loved their kids, but they are happy the program is ending due to all the conflict that they had with AP."
3579017,AD met with AP & HF for AO. HM feels placement is good so far. She has spent a lot of time talking to AP and getting to know her. HM feels that the kids are adjusting well.
3579013,"Hm told me that all is well. She wanted to know when the extension deadline for Takayo is and I explained. If ap doesn't want to extend with them, HF will start interviewing their next ap pretty soon"
3578997,AD met HF & AP for AO 2/9/14. Placement is going good so far and seems to be a good fit.
3578970,HF feels there are enough small issues they would like to meet. We will meet tonight.
3578965,Very well. AP is like part of the family. HF also are in regular contact with their new AP from Italy. They seem to have a good relationship already.
3578916,AD talked to HD.  He said everything is going great and they feel like they are all in the grove.  He said they just started talking about vacation and when they will have it and when the AP wants to take hers.
3578830,HM was disappointed that Minhee has chosen to go home instead of extending as her family in Korea need her support and she feels it is the right thing to do.  HF want to get back into selections so that they can start looking.  Minhee has offered to help them look for her replacement but she is staying until her year is over.
3578814,"Spoke at length with Tamar. She said that she has had some issues with Stine. She said that Stine hasn't been getting up on time for work. She spoke with her about it and Stine cried but couldn't explain why she wasn't getting up. Tamar said that she changed her schedule to 10am to make sure she was on time and Stine came up from her room at 10am and sat to eat her breakfast. Tamar said that she hasn't been attending to her responsibilities and that she (Tamar) spends a lot of time redirecting Stine or just doing the tasks herself. HM said that Stine told her she couldn't get to the laundry and her responsibilities b/c she was too busy with Liya. HM said that Stine hasn't been able to really connect with the kids especially Liya so they put her in daycare a couple of days a week and asked Stine to focus on the other children (all in school) and her responsibilities (laundry, make beds, clean up after meals) HM said that Stine seemed strange with them while in Mexico. She sat away from them and didn't really offer any help. (This was vacation but they told her she would be working.HM said that Stine has no opened up with her. She has asked if she is homesick and Stine said no.She is not sure what is going on but is not sure she wants to continue the match if things don't improve. Stine's mom and brother are visiting this week. Tamar had them to dinner last evening. Also, Stine had a car accident. Tamar said that she doesn't believe it was Stine's fault. She said that Stine is a good driver. It was  a hit and run. She wanted to know Stine's financial  responsibility. Advised that she is responsible for $250 towards the repair of the car. Advised will talk with Stine and follow up with Tamar. She asked about choosing a new ap should thye complete the match and Stine return home in August. Talked with HM about the early bird special."

3578768,Silvia has been awesome. She is doing a great job with the kids. They would like her to extend but they don't want to pressure her as her boyfriend from home wants her to come back to Slovakia. They will asjk her to let them know what her decision is by early next month.
3578767,Barbora is doing well. She is great with the children. She has many friends in the area and is busy during her free time.
3578764,"Calls emaila nd discussion withHM, all is well.  We discussed school, personal life of AP and Gossip concerns."
3578761,"Generally, things are going well. However, AP is slacking on her daily and weekly chores such as laundry, cleaning up after kids, etc. She is also not letting HF know when she wants to take the car and has not gotten her WA DL yet. HM and I discussed the importance of sitting AP down and going over their expecations again. She needs to know that these tasks are part of her job and not optional. I stressed that they should start with going over the things that they like about AP, (they get along well with her, she's good with the kids, good driver, no safety concerns), and they want to make sure the match is successful for the year so she needs to start picking up the slack. She is also on FB and Skype too much while working and HF will bring that up with AP as well."
3578741,Stephanie said that Ayumi still can't speak any english but she is doing really well and they all really like her a lot. She got her drivers license today so they are super excited about that.
3578740,"Things are good with Sam, she is capable and dedicated to the job  Calls and email to HM who states that things are fine"
3578739,"Bea is doing well. She is a little homesick, but she is working it out. She is trying to get her brother to visit. The kids can be challenging for her and the parents are trying to support her"
3578731,"Freida is doing a good job. She has a great attitude and is very sweet. But she is 18 years old and that can be challenging at times. They had an episode a couple of weeks ago where Freida got up from the dinner table and cried, but they had a good conversation and all is good. Her mom is coming to visit at the end of May for a long weekend and she will have time off then"
3578730,"THings are going well, calls and email. HM states AP is fine."
3578728,Perfect- family is very happy with their au pair- so happy they decided to try a replacement au pair- best decision!!  They feel Christie has fit in so well with their family and she has an awesome personality.
3578709,"THngs are going well, all parties seem happy.  HM states that things are good with Ana and all is working. Calls, Emails."
3578693,"Everything is Great - HF couldn't be happier with AP and they have already talked about extending and had questions about deadlines, visa, etc.  HM wants AP to take driving classes so AD recommended Don Tre in Berkeley Heights."
3578689,"Wei reported upon her return that Linda and Jane are doing very well.  they get along well and things have been ""much better.""   They are alternating the schedule and working together well."
3578678,AP is going to extend for 9 months; HF is very happy. I discussed application process and deadline with HM. I will follow up with AP to make sure she knows her education has to be complete.
3578667,AP seems to be adjusting well. She is impatient for her English to improve. It's actually quite good considering she says she's only been studying English for one year. I suggested that she call about getting into the ESL class at the Adult School as soon as possible.
3578666,"HM continues to feel uneasy and not 100 satisfied with the AP, although there hasn't been any major incident lately, other than the suspicion that the AP might be pregnant.  AD asked about how the AP is doing with her mom, and she said it's okay, not wonderful but not terrible.  Since the AP doesn't take initiative to go above and beyond (also since she's pretty good at doing the things she's told to do), AD suggested that perhaps it's best to ask for to do more specific things to improve her performance.

AD spoke to AP and let her know that if she only had a slight runny nose and was tired, she needed to get her act together and be part of the family.

But Charlotte assured her that their family is a bit more open and that Rebecca needs to look at the bigger picture. Rebecca had forgotten to put Zack's booster seat in the car when she took him to school and Rebecca came to Charlotte crying.  Charlotte calmed her down.   Fanny leaving soon and the kids will be sad, so Charlotte mentioned to Rebecca that it will be a little hard on the kids when that happens, for her to be prepared.  Rebecca has already made some good friends in the area."

We discussed a plan of action for that issue.  Sheila also stated that she will discuss how Charlotte parents when Sheila is around.  She would like Charlotte to be a bit more assertive.  On the whole all is going good!
3578312,HM stated everything is going really well.  They want to extend with AP but AP has to decide how long she wants to extend for.  HM stated they told AP she needs to decide by 2/28.  AD stated that AP's extension deadline is 3/1 which is the absolute last day she can extend so she really should submit paperwork this week if possible.  HM asked if AD could talk to AP about that to stress the importance. AD will call and email AP today.
3578308,"Spoke to HM. Things alright, same as.. Just trying to pin down ap on her last work date.

The schedule is a bit easier starting in August, but Dad has a new job whereas he will be traveling more.

3578287,"Everything is going okay. Bruna is doing a nice job with the kids and she is very neat and tidy. Her relationship with the children isn't perfect, but they are working on it"

HF's mother is going to be coming to stay with them and they may wait and see how that works out before they try to rematch with another AP, but they will let us know when date gets closer."
3578216,Ap is different that they expected.

They plan to make a decision soon and will let me know ASAP."
3578156,HD feels that AP has been a little off the last couple of weeks. I offered to speak with her and she told me she has been a little depressed because of the weather. HD will talk to AP about daily routine. Would like things done more on a schedule. Offered my help in case he needs that.
3578152,"HD Malcolm told me, ""All is well. Rubi is on vacation and enjoying the time with her boyfriend.""  HD also mentioned that due to all cold temperatures that AP Rubi hasn't been able to get out as much with their daughter Sasha, but hopefully that will change soon."

They are very excited about new AP arriving and said that they have been emailing and skyping with her at least 3-4 times a week.    HM also had some exciting news - they are expecting baby number 2 in August.  They have told new AP, just to be sure that she is okay with it and she was very excited for them as well."

3578080,HM says everything is good with AP.  No concerns.
3578068,AP left the night before new AP arrived.  HD told her she could have time off to go be with friends and enjoy her last week.

3577938,"Michael reports that things are going well. He states that he and Elisa are still getting used to eachother, but that his girls have really taken to her and have bonded really well with her. They have conflicting schedules, where he has meetings alot at night and he's busy with his son's baseball team, so he admits that it's hard to coordinate schedules to communicate. I recommended holding weekly family meetings, or having her submit a small written synopsis daily for him of what they did, what went well, etc etc. He officially got engaged on Friday, and he states that they have decided to keep her on as their au pair after they marry and move into the new house together. He says that her driving is getting much better, her English is improving, and she's already made some friends and has started going out on her off time."

3577814,Things are pretty much the same. HC hate everything the AP cooks now and they are trying to find a way around it. Otherwise AP is doing OK.
3577813,HM says that AP is still doing a great job with Ashley. She says that they are still disappointed that AP is going out all of the time and has not become a part of the family(this is what they were looking for when applying to program).

3577742,No problems or concerns. HD had a tax questions and AD sent info.

She was a little home sick at first, but now she is settling in and is very happy."

3577594,"Just fine.  Expecting Eve back on Friday, 2/8.  AD asked HD to contact AD if AP is unable to make it back into the US.    AD stated that AP shared with APC that HF wanted AP to stay in placement another 5 days until other AP returned.  HD reported that it was AP who asked HF is she could stay through the weekend so that she could spend time with Eve upon her return.  AD reported that to RM."
3577558,Well- unable to convince Nicole to extend- will miss her- but will start looking for a new AP soon.
3577548,Calls emails and discussion with HM she is happy with AP feels that she should try to stay well throgh the winter by staying in if she does not feel well.  HM will  redo the essay and RHF application
3577532,"very good. AP just returned from taking a weekend course in Albany. HD was asking about searching for new AP since current AP will not extend. AD sent 2014 arrival dates and email to JL, ME for timing."
3577528,OK.  HF is currently traveling in Las Vegas with AP.  They have already matched with a male AP with an arrival for June.  They are hoping to have an AP with less female drama.
3577526,AD talked with HD about the AP having concerns over the placement.  AD asked for a time for a mediation.
3577520,"Spoke with HM and she reports that things continue to be a bit of a struggle with the AP.  AP spends a lot of time in Milwaukee visiting with other AP friends she made when first arriving.  HM does need the AP to work some weekends, and the AP is displeased as this keeps her from going to Milwaukee.  There continues to be some communication issues and the HM really tries to do her best to help make the AP happy.  AD suggested that perhaps extending with a new AP when the current AP’s program ends in June would be the best solution.  HF also has big news that baby Ava was born on 1/29 almost a month early.  HM will need the support of the AP more now than ever with the older kids as they struggle to spend extra time at the hospital."
3577514,HM is excited about this match. She says AP seems focused and mature. AP A/O has been completed. APs car will be out of the shop soon but AP is welcomed to HMs car in her free time if it is available. Children seem to be fine with new AP as well.
3577488,Adele is doing well. She is flexible and always ready to help out. Takes any critic with a smile

3577465,"HM said she was away for the weekend and got a call from her sister who said her housekeeper was upset that AP had 10 friends over and that there was alcohol present.  Went over updating house rules to limit number of guests to 2 with prior advance notice, no males and certainly no alcohol.  AP needs some practice driving, which HF has arranged for her.  AP is younger than prior APs and needs some stricter guidelines."
3577457,very good. All are settling in and getting into good routines.
3577456,very good. family is on vacation right now.
3577434,"It is fine, Nobi does well with Skylar though is still messy. Has Skylar enrolled in a preschool for when Nobi finishes."

3577386,Couldn't be better- the family feels so lucky to have found Carol! They feel like they have known her forever and she is a wonderful addition to their family. Host mom says Carol goes out of her way to help and always seems to know what needs to be done without being asked. The children adore her.
3577378,"AD spoke to HM , she said everything is going great with Dana. AD was asking HM if they planning to reapply for our program . Danna is leaving in May. HM said they had great experience with our program and would definitely recommended to anyone. However HM have a new job and doesn't work full time anymore .

3577368,Very good- family is very happy with their au pair. She is a wonderful addition to their family.
3577267,"HF has been frustrated with a few things. AP was late to PU preschooler from school this week and did not call the HM until it she was almost at preschool. Preschool was upset because she was 1/2 late. AP had been watching inappropriate show when watching kids(Dr. Phil). The car was an issue last weekend because AP took car and didnot let HP's know where she was oing with it. AP is older and has been very independent at home. I called AP this morning and had a good conversation with her. She seemed very positive and was not defensive about anything. She will work harder to remember to communicate and understands the car procedures. See below email to HM.  Laura,  I wanted to let you know I finally connected with Alley this morning. I went over everything you and I discussed. - Communication with host parent's at all times when she is driving kid's anywhere unexpected. Making sure it is OK first. -Being 15 minutes early to Preschool to avoid any tardiness but also in the previous situation what she should have done(Called you right a way so you could have notified the Preschool). -If using the family car in free time she needs to ask. -She also needs to let you know where the car is. -If she wants to take people she needs to make sure its OK with you. -We went over TV use and Computer use.  She told me you and Jason and her had gone over all of this and she understood. I did let her know you have appreciated the time she spends with all of you and that needs to continue. She just needs to be a better communicator when alone with the kids and when she has the car.  Our conversation ended on a positive note but we should all still keep in touch weekly for a while.  Have a great weekend.  Lisa"
3577247,"AD received the email below from HM, so AP called HM to discuss. HM said that AP had been very sad the past two days since she found out that boyfriend was in jail. HM said that AP told her the next day that she broke up with boyfriend. HM was still feeling uneasy about the situation. AD told HM that she would speak to AP to get her side and to stress the importance of cutting ties with the boyfriend and keeping HF and AP safe."
3577236,Great.  We were glad to have Melisa in our home with the children when the snow storm hit.  We both were a distance away and did not have to worry about picking up the children.
3577224,"Things are going well,c alls, email and discussions"
3577216,We hope we can find someone as nice as Nicole when we rematch.  She has been a perfect match.  She has become part of our family.  We all love her very much.  Even our extended family feel she is a part of the family.
3577210,Di has been great! Tess has been very happy! She will look at our program again in the late summer. She will consider extension  aupairs as she has had very good luck with them!
3577209,Everything is fine.  We are busy and glad we have AP

3576995,"Great, she is fantastic. Talked of the possibility of extending. HF would like to but probably too soon for ap to commit. Talked about timescales. AP coming to meeting."
3576934,"Everything is going well, her parents are visiting and driving Niky crazy but she's handling it.  They lost Amni the other day.  He'd come into HM's room at 4 am and curled up on the floor.  When her parents got up they couldn't find him.  They panicked, woke up Niky and called HD who was in LA.  HM doesn't get why they didn't call her, she knew where he was!  Hm apologized to AP about her goofy parents, but Niky was good with it.  Niky passed her written dl test but failed the drive test when she went 23 in a school zone 20, she'll retake it in 2 weeks or so, hm and ap are not worried, she'll pass the next time."

HM also said that she said that she thought that AP did a good job engaging the children and mentioned that AP rarely has all 5 children at once. HM said that sh concerned about her children's reaction to the news that AP is leaving. HM also commented that she tried to accomodate AP Ginger's requests for days off and also invited AP's boyfriend to both dinner and to watch the Superbowl at HF hom.  HM said that they were looking forward to having AP Ginger join them in both Texas and Maine for upcoming Spring and Summer vacations. I did advise HM that 3/9/14 is the official 6 month window. If match breaks in 06/14, then HF will have to re-apply and re-pay all the fees. HM said  that she is still in shock and needs to discuss next steps with her husband and agreed to get back to me early next week with her intensions."

3576829,Spoke with Jennifer. Things are going better recently.  Pia is doing well with making new friends. Kids are coping with Pia. Pia naturally kind of cold.  She is trying very hard.  Trying to mimic the nanny next door.  Pia is not fun and crazy; just her personality. ON the shy side.  She is great on logistics.  I gave Jen some advice about how to approach it with Pia.

3576789,Spoke with Deb.  She said everything was going fine with Lina. Deb never sounds happy to hear from me so it creates an awkward phone conversation.  I asked her if she had any questions and she said she didn't.  Didn't have any more to add to the conversation.
3576773,"All is going very well with Tess, no issues at all.  HM left AD a detailed message.  They are hoping to keep Tess but think she will not extend."
3576769,Pricylla is doing great and kids will miss her.  She is going to help train the new AP.  HM was annoyed regarding the I-94 card issue and felt she should be allowed to go to airport at night to resolve.  AD explained the situation and hopefully they can bring AP to Newark soon.
3576765,AP Corrinna is doing great and family is going to miss her.  She will be with the family for another week then she is going to travel with a friend.  New AP is doing great and kids took to her very quickly
3576763,"HM sat down with AP for two hours to go over schedule, responsibilities etc again. AP did not check one of the boys homework and he missed 3 assignments last week which he has to make up. It is APs job to check the assignments online. AP had to wait for the refridgerator repair man and went to pick up one of the boys while he was still there and left the man alone which she was told not to do. HM wants to give it more time and hopes it works out. AP seems to get depressed with cold weather and AD will check in and make some suggestions."
3576683,AP has decided not to extend. Talked about HM getting back in selection.  HM might be interested in looking at EXAPs.

3576641,"It's going okay. She had to have a sit down family meeting with Andrea, regarding the issues that she addressed with me over email. They reviewed the house rules again and Asja highlighted the important ones, and reiterated that if she leaves the door open again while she's out, that she will be asked to leave. She said that Andrea was very stoic, as if she did not really comprehend the seriousness of the situation. Andrea apparently blames the cat, saying the cat opened the front door. Asja is eager to start with New AP Dave and actually would like to let Andrea go a bit early because she really is unhappy with her and her performance. She plans to sit down w/Andrea soon and discuss an exit date."
3576636,"Calls email and discussion indicate that all is well, the are enjoying Caroline and she is amazing.  Old au pair also visiting"

3576577,AD talked to HF.  He mentioned that their first Au Pair did not work out and APC did a good job of helping with a new one.  He had questions about taxes and AD emailed them info. This was the AD's first time talking with this HF and the HF was a bit cold about the transition and not welcoming at all.  AD tried to be as helpful as possible to give him assurance that they would be well taken care of.
3576561,Esther said that things are going well this month with Ines.
3576481,"Things ar good so far, HF has 2 local nannys working as well so AP has a light week"
3576474,Linda said that Mireia is doing great. She still sometimes can push Mateo's buttons but Mateo can be super difficult because of his autism.
3576394,"I had a very long talk with Brandy. She and Lawrence have started talking to Bella about extending but they are not sure at this point what she will decide to do. If she does stay, it would only be for 6 months. Brandy was very open with me about her Cancer and that it has spread. We talked about the possibility if Bella doesn't stay they will need to search for another au pair and it may be challenging to figure out how to update their profile to explain their situation. I told them that I will do whatever I can to help them with that."
3576241,Katie said things are great with Lais. They did have follow up discussions about their move to the east bay. Katie thinks that they were able to get Lais excited about the idea of moving but they don't know for sure what they will decide to do.
3576117,Things are going ok for the most part. HM is concerned that AP yells too much at the children. HM acknowledges that her 3 year old has been very difficult lately. She sees a change in his behavior and trying to figure out a way to correct the situation. HM intends on sitting down with AP to talk about her yelling. AP also does not allow HC to have certain toys that HP allows and that annoys HM. AD suggested revising house rules and putting everything in writing. AD offered support with facilitating the  conversation. HM will keep AD posted.
3576103,HF and AP re doing very well. They have had three snow days in a row so everyone is a little stir crazy. HM says the AP has adapted well to the cold. They went out horse back riding yesterday in a foot of snow and the AP loved it. HM is very pleased with the AP and says she is steadliy improving in both her English and her assertiveness with the kids.
3576091,AD talked to HM.  She had a couple questions about taxes.  She is going to print all the paperwork out that I emailed and help the AP.  She said all is going well.
3576068,"HF has decided to extend for six more months with AP. HM said this will get them through the summer and starting in the Fall kids will be in daycare full time. HF just came back from vacation on the West coast, they were gone for a week and AP stayed home alone."
3576065,"Spoke with HM and she said AP is good with the children and takes initiate with them and their laundry. HM said that makes her so happy. HM said that she would like AP to talk with her more about things, but that she is sweet as can be. HM said she tries to help AP use her language skills a bit better, so AP can express herself and her needs in a more ""American"" way to HF. Instead of as an ""employee"" and more like a family member."
3576052,"AD talked with HM.  She said AP is doing better and she is hoping she will meet more friends and get out a bit.  She thinks her health is better, but does not think they will extend with her.  She asked me to bring sodas to the potluck and that the Ballston metro is the closest and I could pick AP's up at the 7-11."
3576028,Things are going very well.  HM will be traveling out of the country for work.  Her mom is coming to stay and will coordinate with AP.  The second week the AP will be gone.  She is going on a cruise
3575999,HM sts AP missed work one day this past weekend. AP has a negative attitude. HF is ready for her to go home. HF is using local help until new AP arrives in April. They would consider a short term AP if one becomes available but understand this is unlikely.  HF is not considering a second AP at this time.
3575987,great
3575976,"HM Kritika said that everyone continues to work nicely with current AP Kim. Her Dad recently visited from Germany and AP's best friend from Germany just left. HF hosted both guests. HM commented that she grew up in Switzerland so that she speaks German. HM said that her AP is a ""social butterfly"" so she is happiest when she is around friends and family. HF commented that her eldest son's pre-school ""rarely closes"" so that they weren't really impacted with snow days. Lastly, HM commented that AP Kim will not extend because she wants to resume her studies in Germany. HM asked me and I explained the process for looking for a new AP."
3575974,HM is getting nervous she will not find a new AP for March but said that Latoya has been great and very helpful. HM will help AP with recommendation letter.
3575970,HF is very pleased with AP and home is much calmer compared to previous AP. They are looking at French APs but asked AD not to mention that to AP since she is close to the nanny. Oldest HC has been difficult but AP seems to be able to handle it.
3575943,"Very well, they are sorry to see AP go.  They have gotten a new AP through CC, she will be arriving in March.  They went to CC because they had a bigger selection of AP's to offer. HM said that come January when they're looking for a new AP they will be looking on our website as well.  She had nice things to say about APC, as well as myself.  I told her of course we were sorry to see her go, and would happily welcome her back come January."
3575919,"Very well, they like their AP a lot.  HD Brad asked me a tax related question, so I told him I had already forwarded the tax info to HD Frank.  HD Brad then asked me about my job, so I told him about going to Florida with APC.   He was very glad for me."
3575913,"Very well, Maria is doing great.  I asked if they were still having problems with the language barrier and she said her husband usually deals with AP and the kids and she's heard no complaints from him lately at all.  We acknowledged that there are always problems when you have three adults in one household."
3575889,Great.  HM wanted to make sure that everything was in order for extension year.  AD confirmed that  education completion was submitted.  AD and HM talked about how the weather has been very difficult forcing school closings.

3575753,"Very well, she is very satisfied with AP's childcare.  She and AP had tried to take the kids to Knottsberry farm today, but because of the rain they left early.  Everything else is going very well."
3575752,"They continue to do well.  AP did have a couple of days where she did not get up and start work on time, due to being out late the night before, but HM said that they talked about it and hopefully it won't happen again."
3575709,Everything with Julie is going well. She is driving more and going to NECCO.  She is doing well about her schedule. Kevin is getting more organized  with Julie about  the children like doing  his daughters hair..She is being very responsive.
3575706,spoke with HD David. They are extending with Naty for 6mos. HD submitted the HF application. Reviewed the process. HF is paying the DOS fee. He said that things are great with Naty. The girls really like her. David said that they don't like Jetta's school and will look for something else for next year. Bella has been busy teaching but loves it.
3575651,"AD talked to HM.  We discussed her staying with the program and getting a nanny for secondary use for overnights.  She agreed to look at that and go back into selections.  Her current AP has gotten drunk and thrown up on her carpet, breaks her curfew often and doesn't clean up after herself.  AD recommended mediation and HM said they are fine now.  We discussed rules for new AP and she is seriously considering staying on board.  HC goes to school full time."
3575609,"All is going great with Seda, doing a fabulous job. HF just came back from the Philipines and had a great time.  AD double checked reference for Mor Zilberstein family and spoke about new insurance, as HM's office does accept United."
3575605,"All is great with Camilla, they are definitely extending. Babies are getting bigger and soon will be walking.  HF is in Miami with AP for a few weeks."
3575599,"All is great with Sabrina, no issues at all. Invited HM to come to Jamboree performance as AD knows she is interested."
3575597,AD spoke with HD about a few concerns following an incident with her AP another AP and HF. AD let HD know she reminded AP that whenever another AP is in trouble to always contact the AD first and to not step into a situation that doesn't involve them. HD appreciated the follow up on the situation. Other than this HF and AP is doing well. AP has an incident with the car but things overall are going well.
3575589,All is going well with Elin.  HM finds it very funny that AP needs to write down everything and can't remember anything if she doesnt write it down.
3575584,"All is going very well with Anna, no issues at all.  HM is very sad at this time as her friend is very ill and needs surgery and HM is just worried about her."
3575565,AD spoke with HM about a few concerns following an incident with her AP another AP and HF. AD let HM know she reminded AP that whenever another AP is in trouble to always contact the AD first and to not step into a situation that doesn't involve them. HM appreciated the follow up on the situation. Other than this HF and AP is doing well.

3575553,"Calls, email and discussions about the extension. AP will do 6 months and all papers are in."
3575545,HD called with further questions about extension program. AP would like to return home for a visit in late April and he was concerned about her visa expiring within 3 weeks of her return date. I recommended that they get their extension applications in by March so AP will have her new DS2019 with her when she travels in case there is any question about her status when she re-enters the U.S. We also discussed education options for AP's extension year.
3575520,All is great with Seda.  Family had a wonderful time in the Phillipines and are now back in the cold.  HM did verify her reference for HF Mor Zilberstein.   HM's medical office also accepts au pairs new insurance.
3575518,"HM rather upset, ap had a car accident Tuesday after school and did not call hm or tell her about it until the next morning.  AP went to visit a friend in the foothills and left around midnight.  Not familiar with the area and ran off the road into a field.  She called her friend to come and get her and take her home, leaving the car in the field.  Texted HM about it which hm didn't get so ap had to tell her in person.  So as hm was leaving the house, all of a sudden she had to take another child to school and arrange a tow truck while she was on the way to work.  HM collision deductible is $500 advised hm she can ask ap to pay $250.  Also AP went over the data plan on the phone after hm had talked to her about it.  HM got a bill for $600, phone company waived $300 of it and ap paid the balance of $180.  Asked hm if she wanted me to come over and sit down and discuss all of this, but she declined.  Kids love Gra and she takes good care of them.  As long as she has learned her lesson from all of this, they will be alright.  Advised hm I will discuss this situation with ap and ask why she did not contact hm after the accident."
3575517,"THings are going well, they have really come into place now.  Calls, email and Visit"
3575503,"All is great with Jungmyung, she is not going to extend though and family is going to start looking in March."
3575488,"Well.  Este is great and they are happy.  She finally got her SSN, the bank and driving under control, so all is good.  She called from her son's basketball game so it was loud, but wanted to let me know they are doing well and got all that done."
3575479,"All is going well, talk with AP went well, AP is now more up to par again."

3575447,Great.
3575432,Good
3575414,Great.
3575402,"Everything is great, they've asked Carolin to extend and she's going to stay another 6 months.  This works well for the family as they always take a big vacation in December so don't need an arrival until January of 2015, we reviewed deadlines and while the ap is almost done with school she still has a month to go.  HM is going to go ahead and process her half of the app tonight and advised her to review fees and let me know if she has any questions."
3575366,Great.
3575340,"Amy reports that things are going well. Sofia has offered to help her daughter with her girl scout project.Her daughter has to participate in a fair where she has a booth representing a country, and Sofia is going to help her make the booth about Sweden. Amy is happy that Sofia has taken an interest in her daughter's activities. She's also happy that Sofia passed her FL Driver's License test. She says that Sofia has a hard time finding things to do. AD reminded Amy that it will be warm soon and that she will enjoy things like the beach, pool, etc."
3575303,"Good, still have weekly meeting so communication good. Have decided to discuss extension in March."
3575296,"HM Stacey that everyone is well, despite the miserable winter we've had so far. AP Thais was unable to take the triplets to their Gymboree class a few times because she couldn't get the stroller through all the snow. HF triplets recently celebrated their 2nd b-day party, which was a smashing success."
3575279,"All is going great with Ambre. So great, that the family is thinking about sponsoring her for an F1 visa.  Asked my thoughts on this.  Family going away on the 14th but Ambre will still be around so should be able to go to the meeting."
3575277,"Lori said things continue to ggo very well with Alex.  They all love her.  She did have a question though about sick days.  Alex caught the stomach bug and wasn't able to work 2 days.  She felt errible about it, but they understood and worked from home.  She wasn't sure if they were paid those days and I told her yes."
3575272,"She did call again and said the transition from Maren to Alex ad been very rough, but Alex handled it so well.  Landon would not go to her at first, also because of the Holidays HM and HD were around a lot so that added to Maren leaving.  But Marent old her that may happen and so she didn't take it personally and he came around.  She is so sweet and fun.  He loves her now, as do the others.  So strange that she is probably their last one as Landon might go to Kindergarten next year, depending on where he gets in.  HM and HD work from home a lot and are there after school anyway."
3575259,"HM Julie told me, ""All is well at the Goldstein house.  (AP) Amanda is great.  No complaints... other than the snow."" We commented that AP Amanda and the new AP of the new HF that HM Julie referred have become fast friends since they live directly across the street from one another. HM thanked us for the $300 Amazon gift card as her HF referral bonus and said that she will continue to recommend APC."
3575237,AD called yesterday and left a message.  AD talked to HM today and she was very short.  She stated that she was in a meeting and thought that I was a client and hung up.  AD contacted prior AD to see if there was anything to be aware of because conversation was abrupt and current AD had had a relationship with this HF in the past and there were no issues prior.  AD asked prior AD if I was missing anything and she could not think of anything.
3575231,Good.
3575212,"HD Jay told me that ""Everyone is fine"" and healthy (despite being sick over Chistmas) and ""relatively happy given how miserable it is. Eldest daughter Ellie was off school due to the bad weather but AP Jilli managed both girls nicely."

3575186,Fine
3575185,Spoke to HM. Said everything is wonderful with Michelle. Very sweet natured and spends time with family and pitches in as family member.

Mentioned deadlines in terms of getting classes done.
3575172,Almu is ready to move to the next stage of life.  The boys are very upset that Almu is leaving.  Preston has begun wetting his pants.  Becky re-applied.  She still is not employed but felt it best for when she is employed.  She can jump right in.
3575126,Great.
3575122,Max is doing a great job. Emmett really loves him. He is becoming a better cook and is trying new things. He is dating a local au pair.

3575054,"Everything is great, hm is actually home working today so is observing how wonderful Stephie is in person!  They have had a guy in putting up their blinds and he commented on what a wonderful nanny she has, the baby squeeks and she's on it.  HM mother called the other day too just to comment to hm what a great person and caregiver Stephie is.  HM thinks she'll be at bowling weather permitting."
3574942,HM says that she is due any day now and says that she is going to stay home for one year with the kids. She says that they will miss AP greatly but know that she will always be a part of their family. HM says that they may need an AP earlier and will contact AD.
3574918,placement is going well. HM said Laura booked her flight ticket back home . HM started looking and need to start interviewing prospective candidates for her family. HM said she recommended she recommended our program to one of her co-worker Lisa and gave her my contact information.
3574907,AD had a very quick conversation with HD he had emergency in the hospital. He said everything is going well with Damares . No concerns
3574906,The HM reported that everything is going well with the new AP.  The HM reported that he is routine-oriented which is very helpful.
3574900,Did APO and gave some tips on how the match can be better - driving not good but AP says she is nervous is going for an assessment today and to see what she needs to practice.
3574894,"Very well. HD reported they had a big bash for the Chinese new year, and AP got to meet lots of new people.  He reports the HC are learning lots of new words in Mandarin, they could not be more pleased with AP.  She is very disciplined with the lesson plans, and the HP really like that."
3574876,"HM and AD spoke at length.  Jennifer is confused and disappointed because AP's attitude and demeanor has become progressively worse, and more argumentative.  HM states she is trying to to engage in arguments or discord, because she wants this to end on the best possible note, for everyone's sake, but especially for the children.  AP informed HM that she will be leaving to stay with a cousin on Sunday.  HM is arranging for AP and HC to have a fun sleepover with pizza, pajamas, and movies, etc. for AP's last night.    HM mentioned that she has encouraged AP to *consider* being open to the idea of extending, because it may help her find someone willing to match with her.  HM believes that AP really wants to go home, but she is going through the motions of trying to rematch in order to be able to tell her parents back home that she tried,"
3574869,"Spoke with HM who said things are going fine since mediation last month, no problems on her end with the scheduling, childcare, or AP. AP has seemed tired she says due to the class, but personally I think AP is feeling hurt by the scolding and I will speak to her about how she is coping. Everything okay by HM and she said AP gets nearly ""3 full days off per week."" AP maintains HM schedule usually gives her only 1.5 days off, will check with AP on this."
3574818,"Very well. They took Flora to Chinatown for the Chinese new year and bought her  a bunch of clothes. They paid for Flora's ticket to visit her sister in Washington DC, and they will be going skiing while she's gone."
3574805,"Very well, they're happy with AP's performance. They wish that she would give the children more positive reinforcement, they feel she is too negative with the kids.  They have spoken with her about that. Other than that, HD reported everything is going well."
3574693,Great
3574663,Very well.  She and Rohan get on very well and AP does share off time w/ HF. HM would like AP to be able to connect with any APs in New Haven.  AP signed up for environmental course at Fairfield U.
3574658,"Good, Alex is a great fit for their family. doing well with the boys and schedule."
3574631,HM shared things were great so far.  Explained that they were traveling out today to Turks and Caicos for a 1 wk vacation and just noticed that the AP visa expires today.  Was concerned about the AP's re-enter to the US.  AD cked with RM Nikki and RM disclosed that the DS overrides the Visa date and as long as the DS is correct (AP ends 4/21/2014) that the AP will be fine.  AD shared this with the HM & AP and they were both very relieved.  HM also shared her excitement that they have matched and will remain with APC. No concerns.
3574570,All is going well. AP is helpful and flexible and spends time with AHF when invited.
3574565,"So far things are going great, AP is good with HC and has done hands on projects."
3574494,Marta is doing good. kids love her still. Have put in all extension and looking forward to hearing word back from dos. Not sure if Marta is coming to meeting. Said i would check.
3574489,"HM called me back. Things are fine. Just fine. Not great but not horrible. Seen bit of improvement with her trying to show initative, although ap still has hard time disciplining kids. HM thinks just fundamentally different personalities. They are going to have another cha tin a couple days. Offered to do mediation but she said not neccessary at this stage."
3574447,"Things are getting better. It has been a little chaotic with the new baby, but they got back to a schedule and planned weekends off."
3574364,"Ans says,All is well with them.  They will be  going on vacation the last week (going to Utah) and Betty will be going to Jamaica during that time."
3574262,Everything is great - we love AP and HC especially loves AP = we are well into our second year so of course things are great
3574234,AP notified the HF last night that she is planning to return home to pursue an opportunity to attend school.  Originally she was denied by the school but spoke to her mom yesterday and was told the school has now accepted her into the program.  AP needs to be back home by March 1st.  I still need to confirm timeframe with AP but this is what the HM got from their conversation last night.
3574170,HM called me back. All is good. Been talking to new ap only bit nervous as her English not as good but will have week overlap with Alice and also talked about getting her enrolled in Engish classes asap. Alice talked about taxes but hasn't done it yet. Not sure if she is coming hiking.
3574141,well
3574139,HF and AP sat down to go over expectations and to engage the children more and speak to the baby. AP is settling in and getting to know her routine and seems comfortable.  Will try to meet some new friends.
3574126,well overall
3574051,
3574049,"Spoke with Brielle. She said that things have improved with Michaela. Brielle said that she talked with Michaela about her boyfriend visiting the house, and told her she was not comfortable. Michaela said ok, but did not speak with Brielle for about a week. She felt that Michaela was mad. She said that Michaela began talking with her a week later and now thinks that she has broken up with the boyfriend as there has been no mention of him and she has not gone out with him. Brielle also said that she has seen a change in attitude (for the better.) Things with the girls are great. The girls love her and she loves them. Michaela is on vacation in Miami and returns Monday night. They would like to extend but Michaela is not sure as she has the opportunity to work at a travel agency in the Czech Republic and it is her dream job. Discussed the extension program and the deadline as well as the options."
3574007,"AD talked to HM.  She said the AP is great and they love her.  HM stated that she filed a restraining order for the HD and alarm system.  HM does not feel he is a threat to the children or AP in anyway, but wanted me to know."
3573976,HM still very frustrated with the AP and feels she is demanding more and more. HM says AP  gave HM an ultimatum today that AP wants to take a class for the month of March 8am-3pm Monday-Friday and if she is not allowed to do this she will go home. HM is very upset and feels that the AP is walking all over her and taking advantage of the family and the HM's kindness. HM will tell Ap she needs to talk to AD about the class and then we will take it from there
3573958,"Great.  New AP from other company comes this week and is over lapping to help.  She said she enjoyed working with me in the past and if anything changes, she will contact me."

3573900,"Great. However, AP's license expired yesterday. AD is going to send a new letter for her to take to the GA DMV to get a new license."
3573873,Fine
3573872,"In January, before HM left on her trip while AP Tongxin wasn't actually placed, I spoke to Wei several times by phone and discussed th DOS guidelines specifically, that the hours must be followed for both AP's, both need to be paid, and both need their own room, etc.  I stated that she could not have one work for her business, they had to both be only childcare providers.  She agreed.  Charles said they were doing well when I spoke to him after the match.  He was also happy and said it reduced the stress in the house."
3573863,"Calls, email to HF indicate all is well. SPoke with HD today to discuss the usage of car in bad weather and attending meetings. HDindcates that the HF will be doing work on their home this summer and cannot take an au pair immediately when Yvette leaves."
3573855,very good-HM told me yesterday about extension. I email HM weekend class. AP need 20 more hours education
3573854,Calls email to HM.  ALl is good with AP she will be extending with a new host family because the HM did not want a ful program year and will look at in country when it is time for the AP to leave.
3573822,Good.  The family is adjusting to having a new au pair after 2 years with their previous au pair.  Santino is having some trouble getting adjusted to Seungmi.
3573807,Good
3573800,Good
3573776,Great!
3573771,"Things have been tough since Petra's arrival.  The girls are giving her a hard time but Petra is sensitive and pehaps not taking control.  It is a difficult job though.  She is caring for a baby, a 2 year old and a 4 year old.  The 2 older children go to school part-time (2 half days and 3 half days).  Juggling everything has been hard.  HM mentioned that the cleanup isn't getting done.  Petra apparently hasn't done her own laundry in the past and not much cooking either.  I asked HM about the interview process - she said she thought that since she worked in a daycare, she would have the experience necessary.  I offered to help mediate if its necessary.  HM said things are getting better slowly.  Petra has told me its getting better and better.  There have been tears (both the children and Petra).  HM works from home which is helpful.  I told HM to call me as needed.  I will check in with them regularly."
3573765,Good
3573756,Good
3573753,Good
3573748,Good
3573742,Good
3573736,Fine
3573623,AD talked to HM.  She said the AP was doing great and she liked the idea of her taking the NIagra Falls course.  She said she could have the car for the potluck event.
3573611,HM says that AP is doing great. They enjoy having her as a member of their family. AP has made some friends and has some trips planned. A friend of hers will come from Germany to visit.
3573603,AP is doing very well. Spoke to HD and he says that AP is settling in well and is doing a good job with the children. She enjoyed the basketball game (AP activity) on Tuesday night and plans to attend another game soon.
3573601,"AP is doing a good job and has bonded with Asher. Her limited English has been a challenge though. HD works from home so they aren't worried about safety issues, but their communication would be much easier if AP's English was better. She has not taken the CDL test yet because she is afraid that she wouldn't pass. Otherwise, everything is fine."
3573575,HF and AP have agreed to extend for 6 months. AD sent info and will follow up on the applications.
3573573,Good
3573549,HM says that she is still having a few issues with AP but she sat down with AP this past weekend and went over everything again with AP; schedule and all the duties that are required of her.  HM says that AP has moved away from the schedule and that is causing a lot of issues. She told AP after this meeting that she is giving her 30 days and after that time she will review and decide what to do.
3573482,"All is going very well with Lenka, HD is sad that the year is ending with her and that she did not extend with him, but understands she wants a different experience.  HD is set with after school service for the girls."
3573476,"All is going very well with Lucie, except that her grandmother just passed away and Lucie is not sure what to do.  AP was raised by the grandmother, and that is why she was going home in the first place and not extending."
3573465,All is going very well with Joice.  HM stated that they are all going stir crazy with all this snow and bad weather.  Looking forward to a few nicer days.
3573460,All is going very well. Family is getting ready for their move end of month.  Very excited.  AP is going home to get a new visa.
3573375,"HM shared that things are good.  Shared that she is assisting the AP with school back home.  Unfortunately will not be ext'ing but found out that the AP will need to leave 1 mo early due to school sign up. HM asked if the SFO to help to change that.  AD stated no, that AP will need to spk with her partner in Brazil to see if they can change the in person sign up.  HM asked if they get a refund, AD stated no only a credit because it is over 6 months and they are not eligible.  HM stated she understood. Talked about matching process, etc.  HM shared she will spk with the AP again and let me know what the outcome will be."
3573361,HF thinks that Dana is very tired overall and she is getting attitude towards them which they do not like. They already told Dana that her family can come for a visit in March and they bought tickets. HF will let Dana stay until March and then they will break the match. They would like to do it right away now but Dana's family had already made plans. I asked about childcare and how is Dana interacting with the kids. HD Alan said she was fantastic as always and they have never had any issues with that. they just feel that she is overtired and homesick and she does not want to be part of their family anymore.
3573358,HM stated AP is doing a great job and will miss her.  HM is trying to have new AP arrive early for old AP to train.
3573352,AP is going to Nova for a root canal soon.  Will save money for crown to get fixed here.
3573341,Everything is going well with Kate. She doesn't have a lot of friends and keeps to herself and is spending a lot of time in the house. They had a good conversation about expectations and communication. She is a little insecure and needs a lot of support.
3573332,"HM contacted AD on 2/4/14. AP's care of children is going well. HM asked for guidance with communicating to AP concern of excess hair in the bathtub, drain, and on HC's bath toys.  Discussed cultural differences and as AP is from a remote area it is possible she is not aware of hair clogging drains.  HM believes she may not be as she said early in the match she had to tell AP to through toilet paper in the toilet, not the trash.  HM later contacted AP to tell her she addressed the issue and it went well."
3573310,Sara is doing well. She is getting ready to return home. One of children are scheduled for surgery on the day of the arrival of Leidy. HM would like for her to stay an extra day in the hotel if possible
3573301,All is well with Battina.  She is finishing up everything and preparing for home.  She asked Laiza to match for 3/17 arrival last night at 10 pm and is awaiting her response.  She called back and Laiza accepted!!
3573287,"AP is doing well. More quiet and less out going than previous AP, but no concerns. HM and oldest HC are going to Australia during spring break and HD and grandma will help."
3573281,"Spoke to HM to schedule the A/O. She stated that she is concerned about Sofie's driving. Also Sofie seems to never have had household responsibilities at home, but she has a good attitude and is willing to learn. A/O is scheduled for 2/10/14"
3573212,Not well.  Very frustrated and realized that shed and Kevin rushed into matching with Kelly.  Unhappy with her attitude and lack of listening to what Karri asks.  Karri calls her a hardhead.
3573188,Met with Gaby and HM Ali for the A/O. Reviewed rules and expectations. Ali said that Gaby has been fantastic. The boys really like her ad she is very organized and responsible. Her driving is great. They want her to obtain the PA license. Provided documentation
3573187,"s/w HF, everything is going good so far, they are happy that AP came back after her sister's death b/c they felt they really bonded a lot in the first week.  she gets along great w/kids and already feels like one of the family.  no issues to speak of."
3573165,Spoke to HD. Patricia is doing okay. She is close to matching and will make a decision tonight. All is well with her family. working out her departure time
3573083,very good. Just had baby's baptism and was happy to share the experience with AP.
3573046,Great!  They really enjoyed getting to know AP's bio family.  AP Kate has been going to gymnastics meets with them and they really like her also.  They want to extend with AP but have not talked with her about it yet.
3573045,"Things not that great. AP English is poor. Also ap seems to have little experience working with 3 year olds and how to talk to them. HF practices Rye method and does not want ap to give orders, directions but play, tell stories have fun to help get kids to do things and ap seems to have hard time doing this. Maybe related to English level. AP also seems to have kids late for preschool sometimes and does not practice good hygeine. HF said she has spoken with ap and he is trying but his values seems fundamentally different. I suggested she write her points down for ap since his English is weak. I said i would talk to him too. Will review in a week or so to see how things are going."
3573008,very good. All is going well.
3572975,"Spoke with Erika and everything is going well with Magda, other than she twisted her ankle a while back.  It's been a few weeks and Erika had questions about the new insurance because she wanted to take Magda in to have it checked out.  I emailed her the info."
3572917,Jessie was very excited about her coursework at Richland College. She is taking Accounting and says she has a wonderful instructor. She has applied for her UHC insurance . She went to NY and had a good time.. She has bonded well with HF and children and has made alot of friends.
3572899,"HM was in a hurry as the kids are sick again. She said things could not be better with AP.. she goes beyond what is expected of her. she is going to school, goes to the gym and has friends, AP is easy going and very friendly."
3572845,"HM Cheryl said that things are finally getting back to normal after her twin son Evan was in hospital for 9 days with RSV. Apparently he turned blue and had to be rushed to hospital via ambulance. HM said that AP Maria was a huge help, especially on her day off. Fortunately, baby Evan is home now, recovering nicely, with no development delays. HM commented that AP Maria told her that she doesn't like working some mornings a 6AM as she wants to sleep over at her boyfriend's place. HM told her that the 6AMs are not permanent; only until the twins are sleeping through the night. HM did also comment that AP slept through her alarm a few times and lost an expensive house key fob that is connected to the house alarm. Lastly, HM told her during the interviews that AP would be working ""start/stop"" shifts."
3572841,"Calls email to HF all is going well, she is good with Sidney and they like each other."
3572802,All good with Lisa. She cant come to next meeting though as going to San Diego for weekend. She hasn't looked at tax stuff yet but will remind her.
3572799,HF is really enjoying AP. HM feels that AP is a great fit for their family and things are going very well!
3572795,"HM has a few concerns that she was seeking advise from AD about. Overall she thinks AP is doing a grat job and really appreciates her help and likes Tina a lot. HM said that AP is great about following directions but they are feeling the AP does not do things unless she is told to do them, and this goes from everthing from interactive play with kids to taking food from the table at dinner time unless offered. HM understands that some of this may be cultural but she wanted suggestions about how to get AP to understand to do these things on her own, HM wants her to feel at home and is afraid that she (HM) will overlook something the AP needs because she is busy. AD suggested that HM takes AP to coffee alone over te weekend and talks with AP about the positive things she is doing and discusses things she would like her to develop further now that she is comfortable in the home."
3572791,Good. Twins are 2 in March so growing up fast. Hatsumi fine and all know they have to get extension in asap.
3572787,Things are good with Anki. They are extending for 9 months and she will soon be done with her classes. taking drawing class at smc and weekend course in March. Her friend is coming to stay in march and parents over in April when HF on spring break.
3572786,"Going well. No issues to report. They are very excited to be welcoming new AP Ana this month! Arrival orientation set for March 2, 2014 at 3 pm at the HF Home. AP Raquel has been matched with a new family in San Francisco, after she completes her PY with the Josephsons."
3572784,AD spoke with HD and he said all is going well so far. AP is practicing driving but may take a driving course. She is doing well with the baby and getting along well with HM . has made several friends and is looking into classes at Richland and other colleges.May attend the TCU Immersion Course as well.
3572778,HD is very concerned that AP will feel torn between both host parents during divorce. HD stated that HM often asks AP for information and HD asked AD how to gently let AP know that she does not have to deal with questioning. AD to reach out to AP and explain that divorce is sometimes difficult and should she feel uncomfortable she should certainly reach out ad communicate. HD has suggested that AP be off duty and he will encourage her to leave while HM comes to visit HC on weekend. HD will email AD court ordered custody instructions when he has them. AD thanked HD for keeping her informed.
3572777,"HM Jessica said that AP Chloe continues to be wonderful. HM said that they will not get another AP after AP Chloe finishes the program since HM will have both her children in school FT. HM commented that having an AP has been ""an amazing experience."" In fact, HM and her girls plan to spend 2 months in France this summer visiting AP Chloe."
3572771,"Okay, apat from fact ap has some kind of sore on her face. Asked about insurance info. Gave to them and directed to the Thrive Guide I provide all hfs and aps and has all the info. They said she was going to wait a couple days to see if improved. I said i would check in with her."
3572766,"Called HM back in response to her email. Let her know again that unfortunately APC cannot offer a prorated refund of fees. I did let her know i had passed her letter on to management though to see about letting the OSO know about Colombians not needing to take actual driving tests to get their license. HM said ap is good with the kids and taking the driving seriously but is really not convinced she is going to come to a point where she is safe to drive in the time she needs it, which is now. AP having a couple more lessons over weekend."
3572756,"Erika is doing well.Will know more when Madoka leaves on Sat. She has signed up for an art class starting next week at El Camino, auditing, she thinks. Thinks she is planning on coming to Sat meeting and coming with another local ap."
3572716,"HM Lisa said that everyone is doing well, reiterating that AP Ana is the best AP that have had. HM LIsa did comment that all of her APs have had ""some sort of drama"", mentioning that AP Ana's health continues to be an issue. HM said that AP Ana would not eat their grape tomatoes because they aren't organic. HM Lisa also commented that AP's family is experiencing problems back in Serbia, which is only further contributing to AP's stress."
3572542,"HM stated things are continuing to be much better and everyone is having a good time with each other.  AP is remaining very positive and so HM is able to be more communicative about the things that she wants to improve.  AP is still not great about keeping order in the house and tidying up but they are working on it.  HM is trying to slowly show AP how to do things the way HM like them to be done such as making the HCs beds.  HM stated when she sees AP doing well with HC, she lets AP know she's doing a good job."
3572503,HM says everything is good and she has to start looking for a new AP.  AD went over reapplying and HM will do this today.
3572492,very good. HM is feeling better and baby is doing well. AP went on vacation to Florida and returned last night.
3572488,very good. Very happy with AP.
3572481,"good. AP is very quiet and shy, but HF is happy with her and child care. Would like her to be more outgoing and encourage her to make friends and get out more."
3572480,"HM Jayme and AD spoke at length this afternoon.  AP's flight is secured (HM paid for it on her credit card, as AP does not have one).  AP leaves to visit home on 2/8; HM will email AD the flight itinerary, and AD will post when rec'd.    HM still has doubts as to whether AP really will return from this visit, as AP was in an (at fault) auto accident this weekend and damaged the car.  The other driver involved claims to have been injured and has retained an atty.    AP will no longer be able to drive; as HM pointed out, AP misrepresented her ability to drive various vehicles in various climates -- all of which was untrue, apparently.  AP also claimed to be an ""intermediate"" swimmer, while, in reality, she can't swim at all.  HF HOPES AP returns, but isn't overly confident that she will keep her word.  HM unsure how AP will be able to complete education req. now that she has wrecked the car anbd can't drive, but will do her best to get her there.  That said, HM works overnight and AP's class in in the morning."
3572473,very good.
3572465,Things continue to go as they have been.  Kids are excited to meet their new AP.  Andrea has booked her ticket home for Sunday the 9th.  Her last day of work will be Feb 7th.  She will either have Wed or Thurs off for vacation or she will be paid $36 for the vacation day.
3572442,AP Natalia is leaving program early and going home this week.  New AP Lukana arriving tonight.  HM is traveling for work but everything is going smoothly with transition so far.  HF will pay AP for 1 vacation day and give her 2 days off at the end of the week (Thursday and Friday).  The APs will overlap 1 day for training.  HF is disappointed that Natalia is leaving program but seem to be very understanding although frustrated with the situation.  HF was very grateful for quickly matching with Lukana at minimal cost and for ADs help with the transition.
3572430,"Everything is going well.  Sad to see Martina leaving but excited for new AP, also named Martina to be arriving."
3572363,HM called AD back.  She said the AP was a little sad in January.  She said the AP didn't think her English was getting any better and she was a little home sick.  HM was very encouraging and AP was very social at event.  HF is very happy with her.
3572340,"HF will not be renewing.  They are in the process of moving soon and would be too complicated to start someone new.  No actual new address at the moment to change to, as they will be staying with HF parents on and off."
3572250,"Great.  They want to extend her for at least 6 months.  AD send her fees, payment plans and FAQ's."
3572206,"HD called because AP just found out that her mother has recurring lung cancer.  HD wanted to do some legwork for AP to see what would happen should she need to go home early.  HD called insurance for her and said at first had an argument with Health Care because person he talked to was very rude and short with him, but he finaly got the information he needed and talked to a supervisor."
3572199,"HM said HD has been traveling so it makes things much calmer and easier around the house, which has been kind of nice.  Veronica is getting a better relationship with Angus, which has been good too."
3572194,Good
3572179,HD said everything is good and there have been no issues or difficulties.  He said AP is starting to make more friends and she is getting out of the house a little more and they are happy to see she is adjusting.
3572143,"AD talked to HM.  She is concerned that if the AP goes home in the summer, she will not be able to come back.  AP is on second year and did not get her visa updated her first year.  AP has been given all travel docs. HM wants to know what she should do, to make sure she is covered.  AD wrote RM for recommendations."
3572119,not so good (see notes)
3572115,"First weeks are going very well. AP is getting to know the routine, is flexible and is asking questions. HM will have to address phone use."
3572097,"AD talked to HD.  He said he supported the AP going home early.  Explained that I would need it in writing and I need the AP to give exact dates.  Told him I am not sure if she will get the flight home or not, because she will be leaving the program over a month early, but I would submit it to APC.  They are considering getting her male cousin as an AP.  He would have to sign up with APC on the other end."
3572082,HM said Hana is great. HM have very difficult pregnancy and Hana is a big help. Hana sister is expecting her first child this month. HM know Hana would love to go see her sister so HM bought her a flight ticket. Hana is flying back home this month for one week. HM said Hana is very excited HF is happy they could to something nice for her b/c she's been wonderful to their family.
3572067,"AD spoke to HD , he said they've been asking Adel if she's thinking about extending with them for one more year. She's been with them for almost 8 months HF feels like it's about time to think about it. Adel said she's really thinking about it. I ensure HM about having conversation with Adel and she decided she's extending . He was very happy to hear that. I encourage him to sit down with her and ask her and she will probably brake the news to them by herself."
3572065,everything is good. HM is happy for Anja her friend from Florida will visit by end of February. Hm is planning to have little party for Anja her friend and Anja can also invite some of her friends from our cluster.
3572059,"AD spoke to HM she said Angel is engaging with the children very well. HM payed driving lessons for Angel , driving instructor said Angel was nervous and need more practicing.  Angel hold international drivers license. HM asking her friends and neighbors if they can practice with Angel . She feels like he's getting more comfortable."
3572049,Just fine- no problems at all.
3572036,great
3572030,"HD Jeff said that AP Cindy has been ""simply incredible"", adding that both he and wife feel  so ""lucky to have her (AP Cindy) in our lives.""  HD added that AP Cindy has made  the transition from 1 to 2 kids ""as best as we could ever imagine. Times when we're distracted with Jack, Cindy steps in and makes sure that Ford has the attention he needs, which has made for a pretty easy transition for him thus far.  The affection Ford (eldest son) has shown Jack (new baby) has been remarkable and I think a big part of that is that Ford doesn't feel left out.  For that we are tremendously thankful."""
3572027,Tracey says Tamara is doing a good job and she's happy she is not feeling homesick and has made friends.
3572016,"Things are going well, HM is still a little worried that AP is sad/homesick. HM reports AP is looking forward to Sundays cluster meeting and hopes she will meet more APs. AP is doing well with HC"

3571967,Well- will miss Mari- not planning to get another AP at this point- will see how it goes.
3571966,Well- Hendrik is fixing the toilet in Lina's bathroom. No problems at all!
3571962,WEll- Luke is having trouble with the taxes since Crystal did them in the past- had questions about W2 for Carol- AD explained that APs do not receive a W2 and went ovet teh beasics.  Luke was pressing for more help and AD had to inform him that APC does not give tax advice.
3571952,"Carolina is not really into the job. She is demanding so much from the HF and not giving much back. She requests days off, wants to go to school every day, etc., HM wants to work it out. She did say that it felt like she had an additional child and one that is not interested in her own children."

She flies home 2/12.They have been through quite an ordeal with match breaks, and she almost quit the program. They will use a sitter until the new au pair arrives."
3571943,HM says all is going well and they are getting settled in.  HM says things are good with AP and she is taking ESL on tues and thurs.  HM is expecting her 2nd baby in March and will take maternity leave.  HM is working from home right now.
3571926,Good.  HM is excited about new AP.  He will be here March 17th.  I asked HM if she has told her current AP yet and sh said no.  she wants to wait until next week because she is going out of town and she doesn't want things to be uncomfortable between her mom and AP while she is gone.
3571919,HF is so far happy with AP's performance and fitting nicely into the family.  English is getting a little better.  HD thinks it's because AP is shy and starting to feel more comfortable in the home and her surroundings.
3571917,Host dad was upset because they went to the social security office and were told they need a sponsor letter and the au pair contract. I told him it was not required but he feels its my fault. I apologized and let him APC had informed me that the sponsor letter was no longer a requirement and that I had gone several times to the ss office without it.
3571901,"HM Anna May said that AP Douglas is like a ""new man"" since she had a heart to heart conversation with him about not being glued to his phone and not charging personal expenses e.g. movie and Beyonce tickets to her debit card. HM Anna May said that AP Douglas responded well when she told him that he is a role model for her boys. HM said that she put limits on both his iPhone and debit card privledges. Also, HM said that AP Douglas is helping more around the house e.g. picking up his room, helping carry in the groceries opposed to simply walking over them, again reminding him that he is a role model for her sons."
3571889,"HM Mary told me that, ""Things are going well"" despite everyone feeling a bit ""stir crazy"" from all the cold winter weather we've had here in Chicago lately. HM said that both she and her husband have been traveling for work, despite the bad weather, so having an AP has been especially helpful for all those days that school was cancelled for the girls."
3571798,"Still working on it.  AP just does not seem to like being with the kids or the family.  She does not interact with them and just seems to talk to them when she needs something.  They are still trying to work it out, but have serious reservations."
3571524,Good so far.  They have been trapped in the house due to the storm but they are getting to know each other well.
3571515,Spoke with Erle. He said that things seem to be going well with Lina. He said that the kids told him she is very nice and that they like her. He said that she is very sweet and honest and he appreciates that.
3571483,Spoke with Lekha. She thanked me for driving Narm to the ap activity yesterday. They had a christening in NJ and weren't able. They wanted Narm to meet some of the other aps in the group. Lekha said that things were going really well with Narm. Her English is excellent and she seems to really like the kids.
3571433,"They have had issues with Lisseth's IPhone usage, she's tapped out their data plan last month and now they are paying overages.  When they talked to her about it, she pushed back.  She thought the hf wanted her to stop talking to her boyfriend and her mom, hf said no, you can't use your phone to do it.  AP got mad about this and told hf she didn't want to talk about it anymore.  When she came back later, hf told AP they were done.  If she didn't want to follow the rules, then they need to make a change.  They ended up working through it, but hdad feels they need to have reinforcement from me regarding it.  Advised him I would talk to her about it tonight."
3571416,very good. HC home today so they are watching tv and playing games. AP is happy extension has been approved. AD reminder her she needs to take 6 more education credits.

3571311,Good so far.
3571308,good. AP injured her ankle and is in an air caste. Dr. thinks she will need surgery when she gets back to So. Africa. HM said its been really hard on all of them because AP can not help as much with HC. HM does not think AP will be extending and her and HD are discussing staying with the program.

3571291,Good.
3571277,Good
3571274,"Joy reports that things are going very well. She says that they chose Rhanna primarily because of her strong Christian upbringing, and they are very happy to report that she is doing what they want in sharing and teaching the children about God, Christianity, etc. However, Joy admits that with that comes a sense of shelteredness and naivety, she says that Rhanna is very attached to her family and lived at home for 26 years before coming to the states, so she does think that Rhanna requires a bit of growing up to do in that sense and she hopes that this experience will help her do that, and she has learned that next time she will choose someone who is older and who has lived on their own before. She says that Rhanna talks, texts, etc with her family multiple times a day, to a point where she was doing it while watching the children and Joy had to tell her to stop using the phone during work hours and only use it on her off time. Rhanna has made alot of friends, and has even spent the night with one of them recently."
3571271,Ok
3571267,Good

3571256,Good
3571249,Good
3571240,"So so, AP is asking for a second car so she can go out on weekends. I said HF does not have to have to provide this. HF also has concerns about schedule as is interpreting day and half off to mean 36 hours so counts Friday night through Sunday am as day and a half off. I double checked with RM and reconfirmed that No, AP needs to get a full day and a full 1/2 day off. HF is not sure if this is going to work for her and her schedule and needs to think about it. Also asked about the refund policy."
3571235,Great.
3571215,very well. AP is getting along with everyone and they all are very happy.
3571189,"H mom hada questions of how to deal with broken curfew. AD recomeneded open communication. AP needs to text you and let you know she is ok, safe and when she will be home.

3571031,"HM and AD spoke this morning; AD returned call because she saw that HM had called, earlier, but didn't leave a message.  HM was concerned because she has not been able to reach Zaneta (next AP) in a week, and her phone number has changed.  HM said she spoke with someone in SFO who said they will see if they can help.    We took opportunity to take care of Monthly Contact, as well.  HM Nicole says that everything with AP Evelina is ""great"" and that things really ""just go smoothly"" in this match.  Match 100% compliant."
3571007,"HM Ambre says she ""love""s Martina.  She is doing a great job of engaging HC and of becoming a part of the family.  She spends time with them on her off hours, and even wants to bake with them.  Her only area, so far, that needs improvement is her driving.  She has trouble with the automatic because it isn't a standard transmission, and yet she has trouble with the standard because it has six gears instead of the four to which she is accustomed.  She also has difficulty stopping and starting with the standard transmission on hills (HF's driveway IS a hill).  HM spend hours yesterday practicing with AP, and she says she is hopeful, and AP seems optimistic, too.  Today was to be the day they set up AP's bank account, but because of snow and ice, they have to do it another day.  HF is snowed-in today."
3570997,"Everything is going really well, Carolin is going to come to coffee night tonight and hm wanted me to know that all is great with them, however, she is her own worse enemy when it comes to her attitude.  She isn't depressed but she's so negative about things.  Maybe if I can talk to her a bit and give her some advice."
3570981,"HM had questions about travel month. AP is thinking of extending for 6 months. HM was wondering if AP would get the 30 day travel month at the end of the first year, then again at the end of the program. I told her that APs only get the 30 day grace period at the end of the entire program. HF will also provide AP with one week of vacation if she extends for 6 months."
3570968,"Everything is going great, super sad about the Broncos but they had a good time watching the game.   hm is wondering if they brought Toon to my house tonight if she could ride with me to coffee night.  She has a driving lesson tomorrow and hopefully will be up and running here in a month or so.  Told hm that was fine, I am taking another ap home as well so they can get acquainted.  She will have Toon here at 630."
3570954,"HM and I spoke thgis morning about going back into selection for a new german au pair in August. I told HM that since she still has 6 months to go with current ap, the system might not allow her to reapply.  I have RM to clarify. HM said that things with Davina are going well and she is pretty sure that ap will finish her year. HM just wants a head start on the interviw process to have plenty of time to find the next one."

HM understand Marina didn't have to do any of this in her previous placement but she also expect those things to be done in her house. Marina said she understand and will try her best to finish her tasks. I encourage Marina to talk to HM if she can finish something that day like clean kids bottles or clean up kitchen she needs to communicate with HM why she didn't finish it  not just wait if HM will ask her or will let it go.
3570841,AD spoke to HM he said things are going well. Last night they had super bowl party Ad really appreciated Natalia's help prepare snacks ready. HD they all flying to Florida on February 14 for 4 days.

3570829,"AD spoke to HM she said everything is going well. Misa's program ends on July 9, they asked her if she would like to stay with them and travel. HF is planning to go to Niagara Falls and Texas. MIsa would love to go . HM asked me since MIsa's drivers license expired in January if she can renew her driver's license for one more month. I told her I will find out. I told HM after AP program ends AP has 30 day period time for traveling not working. She said she knows they would like to do something nice for her before she leaves ."
3570815,AP has decided not to extend after all and AD told AP to send in her RFR and discuss last dates with HF. HF will reapply and look for APs. Either OS or ICAPs but most likely IC.

3570783,Things are not going well.  HM and HD sat down to discuss things with the AP and in the end she said she cannot handle all three kids.  She asked the HM to put the twins in full time day care.  The HM stated that the nature of some of what the AP discussed disturbed her.  AP made mention of being disgusted when changing Declan's diaper and that she did not like being home all day without an adult to talk to.  HM said it seems as though some of her core jobs she is finding out she does not like.  HM is going to put the twins into full time day care hopefully starting Monday.  HM does not feel that she can or should leave the AP with all three kids ever again.  Due to this change the family cannot pay for the AP and full-time day care for the twins.  They would like to know options available to them.  HF does not wish to host another AP.  HM made mention that she is fine with allowing the AP to stay through May so she can finish her schooling.  Need to discuss early release options with RM.
3570780,"Both parties agreed to work out their differences.  Both has complaints, but want to try to work it out.  AP has found some outlets to get out of house and has become happier so thinks she can do a better job.  HM expressed that she understood need for AP to get out of house and agreed to be a little more flexible on AP working Friday nights.  AP will ask if something is planned for Friday nights and if possible, HM agreed to let AP go to outings on Friday nights."
3570613,"AD spoke to HM , she said Marina is great playing with children, Lucas the older  one loves her. HM said the only issue they experiencing is Marina can't meet their expectations she doesn't know how to set up her day to get things done .

She understand this is all new for her and she's struggling to get things like kids laundry, make kids beds, clean high chair after eating and wipe kitchen table  done . HM and Marina spoke about it and they will both try to make things work. Marina said she would do her best to finish her tasks.

I'll check with both of them how's everything is going  next week."
3570601,"AD spoke to HM , she said Jessica is doing fine, situation is not even uncomfortable she thought it would be. She hopes Jessica finds new family and happiness. HM is considering one ICA to match with but her program ends in August and HF would have 3 unused months. This is HF last year with APC HM is trying to figure out what would be best solution in this situation. Leave our program and get reimbursement or loose money in 3 unused months.  Jessica stay until February 13 and provide childcare."
3570569,Fingers crossed that DjiDji's extnsion comes in quickly!
3570567,Well- thinking of asking Rosario to extend- she is returning from El Salvador this week.

3570547,HD says that AP & the kids are doing fine - all settling in nicely
3570527,"HM called the AD and they spoke on the phone.  The HM reported that she has noticed an improvement with the AP since last month.  The HM let the AP know that this is an exchange program and she encouraged the AP to engage in activities with the family more.  The AP was hesitant at first, but now is more engaged and this has helped to develop a more positive relationship."
3570518,So far so good.  AP has been driving around area. Morgane left today and last night AP met a few of the girls in the cluster who came to say goodbye.
3570488,"THings are going well, there has been improvement since I spoke with Thais.  She has however, made a decision that it is not going to work for her to remain in the program fr her extension year as she feels she needs to return home for schooling and work preparation."
3570485,Calls email inidcate that things are going well.  AD discussed DOS guidelines after AP asked if her hours were okay.  All hours were within guidelines and in fact less than the 45 hours expected to work.
3570483,Things are going well.  The HF ad AP have worked together this week to resolve conflict and disussed all concerns.
3570445,HM has been very sick... was home almost all week.  Went back to work and still feels lousy.  Talked about AP's last week.  Last date is 2/18 but both ap and HF agreed on 2/14.  HM acknowledge that ap will not return to her home country per program guidelines.
3570440,"HD said AP is doing just fine, she picked up right where the other left off and it's been a good transition."

3570434,HM said AP is doing her job and they have no issues.
3570427,Everything is fine so far. Not much different than a few days ago.
3570424,All is still going well this month with Daniela. Same as a few days ago.
3570423,All is still going well this month.
3570418,Things are going well. Only a couple weeks left.
3570417,Things are going fine. AP was enjoying time with the older HC a lot when she was off from school earlier in the month.
3570416,"Things are great, as usual."
3570415,"Things are going well so far, although it's only been a few days."
3570414,Things are going really well. AP enrolled in a West Valley class which has been really challenging her. HM is not sure she likes having to stay in the house more to study then she used to.
3570413,Good.  HM said things are fine she is just busy.
3570412,"Good. HM said all is well, they are glad to have AP go on vacation with them in a couple weeks."
3570411,Good.  HD said all is well everyone is just trying to get as much sleep as possibe.

3570400,"HF is doing well. They are sorry to see Bank leave, but are looking forward to the arrival of their new AP, and are excited to be hosting another AP from Thailand!"
3570399,Things are going really well. HF is considering asking AP to extend with them. AP really feels like part of their family.
3570384,AD saw HD at monthly event when he picked up AP. He stated that things are fine and the family  remains very happy with AP.
3570382,Great.  Diana has been great and she is doing well.  HM stated that her husband is deployed for a year and that Diana would be gone by the time he returned.  She feels that Diana will be good throughout this transition.
3570380,All is good with AP.  Lydia is continuing to have health problems and they are still considering the brain surgery option.  They are still in their temporary home and will begin to search for a house soon.  Sally was going to come to the outing last Sunday but the sitter for Lydia fell through and they could not come.
3570379,Things are great with Alina.  The HF and AP are leaving for FL on Monday to get away for a few days.  They are all very excited to get to the warmer weather.  AP had a great time at the outing last Sunday.
3570377,"Per HD, things are great with Beatriz (they call her Bea).  She is very happy with the HF and is great with their son.  Her English is a little weaker than Dounia's was.  She is starting her first ESL class at CLC this week, which will help.  Overall, they do fine with the language barrier.  They write down instructions, have her repeat back and speak slowly.  AP has started to make friends with other local AP's - most are Spanish-speaking.  This has made it harder for her English to improve because they always speak Spanish to each other.  AD will talk with AP and encourage her to try and speak English - and also to make friends with other AP's that don't speak Spanish.  This past week, they have had a little communication problem with her schedule.  Per HD, they are very careful to stay within the DOS regulations (which we reviewed on the phone and he was correct).  AP does need to work 1/2 days on Saturdays if Lisa is working.  HD thinks that possibly her new friends are telling her that she shouldn't work on weekends.  AD is trying to ask about these hours - but HD feels her question is getting lost in translation.  We discussed that he should encourage her to write down her question and let her know that there are many AP's that work some weekend hours.  HD stated that they are by no means complaining about her, they just want to make sure they understand her concerns and are able to address them properly.  HD will make sure she knows that if she has plans to do something special - they will make every effort to give her that time off.  HD will let me know if he needs me to get more involved."
3570376,All is great with Vikki.  The HF and AP are going to Florida / Disneyworld next week.  They are all really looking forward to it.  AP is doing a great job with the kids.  AP's family will be coming to visit in the Spring.  HM has been talking to a coworker that is currently with CC.  AD met their AP at my last outing.  The HF is not happy with CC and is thinking of switching to APC.  LInda gave this family my info and they will be reaching out to me soon.  AD thanked Linda for the referral!
3570374,"All is great so far.  HM commented that this is a ""great match""!  AP has jumped right in with the kids and is doing a great job.  Her English is very good too.  AP went to the snow tubing outing last weekend.  She was able to go with 2 other local AP's.  HM drove her to one of those AP's homes.  See also Welcome Call note.  APO set for Wed, 2/5 at 12:30"
3570369,HM says placement is ok.
3570321,Checked on driving progress and what they had decided as far as allowing Mook to drive. Zehra feels Mook is too timid to drive and prefers to be driven although this is inconvenient. Zehra is glad she is getting out more with other au pairs and she seems happy to be here. Things are settling down after her parent have left so they are establishing a routine finally.
3570309,Things are good. They like Mamen. She is getting better with being stronger with the kids and they seem to like her. Robyne is glad she has found a new friendship with Sara and they spend a lot of time together.
3570306,All is great. Everything runs very smoothly at home. Thanked her for referring their friends in Livermore and mentioned that they had very nice things to say about Lerissa. Also praised Lerissa at what a good au pair example she is to the new girls.
3570276,HM says all is good.  Everyone has been busy and she has been doing a lot of international travel for work.  They are likely not going to renew once AP's ext is up next month.
3570273,"AP gets along vey well with the son.  AP has made some really nice friends in the area, and goes out a lot on the weekends.  HM is happy to see AP having a good time."
3570269,"Potty training the younger son is proving to take longer then anticipated.  Things are going well with AP.  The older son is behavior is still improving, so HM thinks things are working out."
3570268,HM is very happy with AP.  AD did ask if AP is working every Friday and Saturday night except for her weekend off.  AD explained that it would be beneficial if AP could see her friends more on the weekends.
3570264,AD thanked HM for referring a HF to APC.  HM is very happy with the program and it affords her the opportunity to work out of the home 3 days a week.
3570261,HM had some tax questions. AD explained that she is sending out a tax email for HFs.
3570260,Spoke with HM. Congratulated on her graduating from dental school. Things are great with AP Babi. They are having a big Super Bowl party and need her to work on Sunday.  Talked about them going away next month.
3570258,AD thanked HM for the recent referrals she has provided to AD for APC.  HM is very happy with the program and shares the wonderful experience she has had with her friends.
3570250,"HM says everything is going well.  HF is going to participate in the ""Fairfield County Cookbook""  AD came up with this idea to help APs learn how to cook American food.  HM can not believe how cold this weather has been in the past week."

3570242,Great.  AP is still quiet but HF really likes her.  AP is starting to feel like part of the family.   HF said the kids have been playing out in the snow and having a great time.
3570241,"HF feels that all seems to be going well, hmom is 7 months pregnant. HF/AP were in Colombia recently and had a nice trip. They will be staying in Orlando for a while, no plans to move at the moment."
3570232,Great.  AD told HM that AD was creating a cookbook for the au pairs.  Each family will be contributing one idea for the book.  HM that this was a wonderful idea.
3570231,"Things are going well.  AD thanked HM for sending AD a holiday card, no one has ever done that before.  HM was curious as to why a HD she referred did not enter the program.  AD explained his circumstances changed but did not elaborate."
3570227,"AD and HM talked in great length about how the kids and AP are getting along.  AD said that every time she sees AP, the AP comments how things have improved with the kids so much.  HM does see some improvement, and will keep the match for the program year."
3570222,HM referred family to program and they have applied.  AD and HM discussed what needed to be completed in order to extend with AP for another year.  AD explained that AP will need a CT license and must complete her course completion for the current program year.
3570217,HM had a question about paying taxes for AP like she had to do with Nanny.  Ad explained that she does not need to pay taxes due to AP receiving a stipend and falling under a program with the Department of State.
3570205,all is great
3570184,"All is well, HF parents like AP and host kids love her, according to host mom. They had a good time in Lake Tahoe."

3570156,"They all have been going a little stir crazy with this harsh weather. They have Katli in preschool two days a week now, which will start next week.  Laura had her credit card information stolen when she was in Mexico but the bank and the credit card company have covered the fraudulent charges that showed up."
3570153,"Nagyla is having a hard time getting used to this weather. The kids were home two days due to the cold this week so she really had to jump right in.  She has a great personality, very helpful and engaged."
3570143,Everything is going well.  Knows about AP Arie leaving and all the au pairs in cluster were sad to hear about it.
3570133,Keiba says all is well.
3570132,Very well- Hendrik is surrounded by girls!  says Lina is wonderful.
3570127,Everything is going well.
3570118,"Everything is going well.  HM had one questions about AP having a boyfriend who travels to this area for work.  On her weekend off, AP stayed at local hotel with boyfriend - this is okay with host family.  However, she looked really tired and not ready for work.. HM is worried about this becoming a problem.  It was agreed that if it happens again, HM will call AD and we will talk to AP together about the issue.  Otherwise, everything is gong well."
3570107,The HM had been under the weather but is feeling much better. She states everything is going great.
3570103,"All is good with HF except they are having a little struggle with AP's English skills.  See also Welcome note.  AD has spoken with HM a few times.  Unfortunately, AP will not be able to attend classes at CLC until March.  However, she can get into a free ESL class in North Chicago held at the library to get some interim practice.  AP is also nervous to drive right now.  HM plans to take her out while the roads are good to get a bit of practice.  APO scheduled for 2/6 at 10:30am"
3570096,Everything is going well so far. AP is only needed 2 hrs. a day right now until the new baby is born in three weeks. Everyone settling in very well.
3570070,I spoke to the HM and everything is going well. The HM is very pleased with the AP and can't wait for me to meet her during the orientation on Sunday.
3570058,Things are still going well. HM said that AP seems to have really bonded with the baby and the triplets really like her as well. They are set in their schedule and there are no issues. AP is also social and is getting out.
3570044,Good.  HM said all is fine and she apologizes for being late to respond but things are fine so she has nothing to report.  She has started thinking about if she is going to get another AP when her current AP leaves and hasn't decided but will keep AD updated.
3570037,"Spoke with Venus at the Jan AP outing, snow tubing at Wilmot.  HM and one of the kids actually came with us.  She is doing great - just having a hard time getting used to these frigid temperatures.  No issues with Carina."
3570019,Things are still going well. HD and AD agree that AP is a very solid AP. The children really like AP as well. HD inquired about renewing and when to do that. They will look to welcome an in country German AP when its time. AD explained the process.
3570018,They are doing very well.  The HF and AP's took a little weekend break last weekend and stayed in Antioch to be able to spend the weekend at Wilmot tubing as part of our outing.  Both AP's attended and had a great time.  The HF will not get a second AP right away when Edith leaves - but they will overlap with Renee for a month or two later in the summer.  We discussed that HM is very involved with MOM's (Mothers of Multiples).  She has several families that might be interested in hosting an AP.  We discussed securing a promo they could use.  AD exchanged emails with RM and will email HM to let her know about the MOMS promo.  HM may also be able to get something in their newsletters to promote APC
3569974,"HM, AP, 2 HC flew in yesterday.  HD and FIL are en route driving one of the family cars (the other one's being shipped) from NJ and will arrive by Sun.  The flight was hard for the 21-month-old toddler, so the HM is glad that they got in safely.  They're staying with her aunt's family in the Woodlands now and will move into the townhome they're renting in Conroe soon after the HD arrives.  AD gave the HM a good overview of the cluster and let her know of the upcoming Feb event (Valentine's Day Party) on the 9th where the AP will get a chance to meet everyone.  They're both very excited to start this new adventure in Texas.   AD also learned that they now have a 3-week-old infant and the 6-yr-old step daughter is staying in NJ with her mom.  HM has another 3 weeks of maternity leave and then will return part-time after that."
3569953,Spoke with Jason. He said things are going really well with Gabriella. They had a party for Lu last night and he said that the boys cried. They are so sad to see her leave. Jason said that many of their friends stopped by to say good bye as well. She has been one of their best aps ever. Jason said that Gabriella is terrific. She hardly worked the first week and did not want to take her pay b/c she didn't think she deserved it! (They paid her!) Scheduled A/O for Tuesday February4th at 7pm.
3569941,All is well with them.  The HF is still struggling financially but they are making it work and AP has been paid.  The HF will take a break from the program when AP leaves to get their finances in order for a while.  They hope to be able to come back again.  They love Dulce.  She is part of their family. They are getting very sad that her year is coming to an end soon.

3569496,

3569439,HM said AP has really stepped it up.  They're glad she extended and is working well with the baby's nanny.  They may change up her hours within the next couple of weeks as HD works from home and his job isn't doing well.  They will probably pull second youngest out of pre-school.
3569436,Spoke with HM. Everything is going well with Anna. Reminded we were doing a food drive on Sunday
3569432,

3569390,"I said looks like you are trying to find time to get into FR and look around.  She said yes, trying to decide if we will get another. I offered ICAP if they are not wanting to make the year commitment. HM said those make me nervous. I told HM matches don't work for a variety of reasons and I gave her examples.  I said we are very honest and open regarding why matches didn't work out.  We don't want another match to fail."
3569383,Good.  HM said things are going well since they had the pre-extension discussion.  AP has been abiding by the new curfew and helping around the house more than she was.
3569380,AD spoke to HD.  HM is in CA at her company national sales meeting.  AP has been a big help this week while Hm has been away.  AD asked how AP's sister surgery went the other day.  HD said all went well and she is recuperating.  AP was very relieved to hear all went well with surgery.  HD said AP is an excellent addition to the HF
3569375,"HM said that AP is doing a wonderful job and they really love her. HM said that AP is having some issues with HC because HC is 13 and thinks that she doesn't need an AP. HM said that HC really likes AP, but sometimes she is not once to her and HM has had to talk to HC about that."
3569373,HF is very happy with AP. They are still getting to know each other.

3569310,they are very happy with the job that Carolina is doing with them!
3569309,good
3569307,Good. Hard to believe APs year is about over. HD is going to take a few months off and save some money and then think about coming back in May

3569291,"Just fine - she's a great girl.  Elena is learning how to drive!  Scary for HM, AP enjoys it very much."
3569284,Fine - getting to know each other this week.  HM was out of town til Tuesday night so she didn't get a chance to bond very well until literally a few days ago.  APO scheduled for sat at 10 am
3569283,"just great.  She's a really good girl.  Very prompt and timely.  Totally into the family when she's working - when she's off, she's an adult and can do what she wants.  Is keeping the family #1 priority.  If that changes, they will let me know.  Move slated for march, baby still due late Feb."
3569280,"APO was ok. It was 3 hours long.  AP's English is a bit weak but it will work and it will improve.  HF had concerns with Ashley's childcare responsibilities in China as she did not know how to change a diaper and wondered how she had under 2 experience. She told the family several times she changed diaper but when we translated it she said No...not many times. I told her Several means many times and she said ""OH"".  She does not know how to do many things around the house but HM is showing her. She realizes she is making many mistakes but she said she is trying to improve. I told her to keep her AP diary with her so she can write and take notes to help her remember. HF had some other concerns with her always saying yes she understands but she really doesn't.  We stressed this to her over and over again how important it is to tell them she doesn't understand.  AP is training this week with Grandma and Nanny from China. HF said there is no way she can be on her own with Max right now.  We used Google translate for many words to show her what to do and what not to do.  1st day of work, AP was off at 7:30 but HM was not home yet and Grandpa was there helping her. AP told Grandpa she had Chinese Friends that wanted to come and take her out to Ann Arbor area that was 1 hour away and she wanted to leave work right at 7:30. Grandpa called HM at work which typically you can only call HM unless there is a true emergency and asked HM if she could go to Ann Arbor with friends on her 1st day/night on the schedule. HF was not happy with this. AP also asked for her weekend off this weekend to go to Chicago with friends for Big Chinese Festival. HF is going to accommodate this but explained to her that this is her weekend off and that she won't get another weekend off until March.  HF was not aware AP had friends in Michigan and she also has a boyfriend in China.   I told HM that I would check in next week and see if things have improved."
3569278,APO went GREAT! HD very happy with Lea. No concerns or issues at all. She is very helpful and has jumped right in with the kids crazy schedule with no school due to snow and cold weather. The kids adore her and want her to stay as long as possible.  She is volunteering at the kids school already.
3569276,Well
3569275,Anne is great!  The APs came over for Gasparilla since their house is close to the parade route.
3569273,Very well- looking forward to welcoming Nora.
3569272,Good.  HF loves their AP.  HM is not sure if they will get another AP.  It is almost time for their daughter to go to school so they might do that instead.
3569271,Well- working on a neighborhood family who may need an AP.
3569270,Everything is going good.  No concerns for HF.

3569205,"HM says the placement has been going well- better than the last. HM says AP is still not tremendously confident in the kitchen, but has been well-trained in other ways for the household. HM also said AP gets around well in the city on the bus line. HM wanted her HC to visit Phoenix for the summer with grandparents- also it would relieve HM during hectic residency months.

HM does not feel that her two year old is safe when with the AP as there have been a few situations where the AP did not make the best judgement.  AP gave the child a bowl of whole cherries with the pits and left her unattended to eat them.  The HM found the 2 year old with a bottle of medicine and when the HM pointed it out to the AP the AP had no acknowledgement that there was an issue.  HM is not sure that things are going to work out as she is concerned for her youngest's safety.  HM said they wil have another talk with her and let AD know how it goes."
3568830,I have called Tiina a couple of times at work and a couple of times at home and left messages.  I have also sent an e-mail asking she or Matt to get back with me.  I have still not heard back from them.
3568810,things are great and they are very pleased to have AP extending.
3568803,I have not been able to contact either HM or HD.  I've called all the numbers I have for both of them and left messages with the au pair.  I have also e-mailed both HP asking them to get back with me asap.  I recently sent an e-mail and copied my RM on it because I always have such a hard time getting in touch with this HF every month.  Richard called to say he should be the one I call because he works midnights now.  He's back on the street as a patrol cop.  I will post a note with the best time to call and the best time to reach him.
3568795,"very well-- there have been a few problems, but they have had great conversations and things are better than ever"
3568788,great-- can really tell how much the AP cares for the children and how much they enjoy her.
3568778,"HM would like us to text in the future before call.  Everything is good, the same."
3568775,Michelle says that they are very happy with Leti and that she seems happy to be with them.  They have been very busy but she is doing a good job
3568769,"Good.  HM said all is well.  They have already been thinking about what they want in their next AP.  They hope to match in time to get the early bird discount.  HM said they think this time they want a European AP.  They would like someone with a little bit better English initially, as well as better driving skills so that it does not take the HM as long to feel comfortable with the AP on the road."
3568739,HM returned my call.  She says things are great but very busy for everyone.
3568731,"fine (always hard to track this HM down but she finally answered her cell!) no problems with AP - she doesn't spend much time with the family but HF is ok with that - she's good with HC, especially baby"
3568727,"Fine, HM thinks!  AP is so quiet and reserved!  HM asked AD if AP was happy - AD said AP says she is!  AD doesn't hear much from her either!"
3568725,"Shannon called me, she sounded really sick, she shared with me that the whole family is sick, including the AP. They all have the FLU. She stated that everything is great with Dahena and that they are thinking of extending the program for another year. She had some questions regarding the program fee."
3568721,Great!  No problem - an absolute love
3568711,Everything's fine - au pair does a great job with hc - no issues - we'll be sorry to see her leave in march
3568709,"Things are going great with Mada, they love how she is with Chloe and she loves Magda. Doris said they loved being in Poland for the holidays, Magda wanted to stay here and has plans to be with friends and seemed to have a good time."
3568707,Everything is great - AP and other AP are a great team - lots of love - everything going very smoothly
3568704,"Cami is doing well with the kids,things seem to have all worked out between them.Rob has no concerns, all is good as far as he is concerned."
3568702,Settling in well- is starting to look for Deron's replacement.
3568688,Not well - moved to rematch - see mediation notes
3568683,Stacey & Josh are very happy with Pam . They are glad they decided to take the leap of faith and get an AP. Pam has become a family member in more ways than one.
3568670,"Things are still going very well with Cami. They had a great holiday season, it's nice having Cami be part of the family. Her English is still improving. She attended our cluster event and had a great time. She is coming to Momma Mia with her cousin.She will not snow tube"
3568664,Talked to HD who stated that things are going well with Sandy. He also told me that he has started looking for a new AP.
3568659,"All is going great.  Yareth is getting close to the end of her extension period, but she is doing great and they are very happy."
3568645,Things are great with Mieka and Rosy. They are comfortably making the needed transition from one AP to the other. The kids are taking to Rosy well. They are busy with school plays and winter activities.
3568635,"Robin said that things are not going so well with Itana these days. Itana's focus seems to have shifted from her HF & her responsibilities to her boyfriend and her time off. She has been late picking the kids up and asks the nanny if she will take on her hrs. HM said that she complains often about the BMW ,asking if she could use the other car. It seems her boyfriend lives in a very large expensive home with his family. Robin said this shift occurred after they apply to sponsor her. HD feels she may have decided to get married, because she doesn't seem to care that they are frustrated with her."
3568622,"Hmom reports that all is great with AP Vianey, she does a great job with her childcare.  Mom had several questions which I answered regarding the Extension year. She and AP are in discussion about extending now.  Mom says AP is creative and comes up with fun games and activities for the kids.  Hmom also reports that AP has been great with the baby."
3568551,"Hmom is very pleased with APs performances.  They love her and so do the kids. Mom reports that AP has signed up for 2 classes one thru Oakton and one thru Trinity.  Mom reports that AP has a healthy social life.  Mom says AP is probably going to take her last week of vacation in April sometime, they are working on details.  Mom would love to extend with Jessi, but is not hopeful that Jessi will want to only because she misses her family and boyfriend."
3568544,Great. HF is happy to have AP here.
3568474,AP is adjusting well to HF.  Hm is thankful AP has arrived to help with the children.  AP shows no signs of homesickness.  AP and HF have had fun playing in the snow this week APO set for 2/4
3568464,Daniel says that things continue to go well - they have been really busy and Keiko was called in for emergencies to the hospital.  Looking forward to some warmer weather.
3568430,"Spoke with Danielle.  Everything is going well with Vera.  Vera was out of town for 10 days so thing were hectic, but back to normal now.  Apologized for not getting back to me sooner.  Suggested I text Vera to call me because she doesn't check her VM."
3568427,Very well.  HM said she is doing a great job.  She has taken 5 days of vacation and will take more in spring.  She has finished her classes but still needs to get the paperwork signed.  HM says she wants to extend and would like to go home but that is going to be problematic.
3568425,HM returned my call.  She says things have been busy because she got a new job last month.  Says things are good with AP.  They spoke about the smoking and the situation seems to be resolved for now.
3568416,"After AD left several friendly emails and then sent an email, HM called back and said ""everything is fine with Andrea - Goodbye"" Then hung up."
3568398,"HM Alysa apologized for nor calling back; she has a cold and sounds awful -- and apparently feels worse!  She said that things are ""fine and good"" with AP Mags, and that Mags finally rec'd her SS card, so they are in the process of getting her set up with a bank account.  She (HM) confirmed that match is 100% compliant."
3568385,"met with hm and ap for the apo. HM said Yohan is doing great. He is making a great connection with the children. Driving is going well too. So far, everything is great."
3568365,Everything is going well and thanks for calling.
3568361,"He said good, Estelle started classes this week. Too bad her first classes are when it is so cold!"
3568359,"HM said all is good.  She and AP are looking to extend together--not sure of amount of time, yet.  AD sent extenstion info to both of them."
3568358,"HM Deanna returned AD's call.  They are on the hunt for their next AP -- driving is essential, this time.  They like Mirian very much, and will miss her, but she just isn't up to their driving standards, and for that erason, they will not extend with her.  AP does well, otherwise, though, and match is 100% compliant."
3568357,Match is going OK but AP is very different.  AP is very quiet and to herself.  HF had hoped to have AP engage with HF and want to be a part of HF.  HM says next AP will probably be a boy...the kids seem to interact better with males.  AD asked HM if she is ok continuing the match.  HM says they will continue the match.  HM will have to work with AP when summer comes so AP has planned activities.  AP is not a planner and the kids will get bored extremely easy if AP does not plan the day.  HM did mention AP is not a very good swimmer and HF has a 5 year old child.  AD asked if she was OK with AP watching children at pool.  HM says she is comfortable.  AD said HM should address safety at pool in May whn pool opend
3568354,"HM Nicole returned AD's call; things are going well, and match 100% compliant."
3568330,Linda will not stay for another year. HF will start looking for another AP.
3568323,Everything is well. Mariana will join me for the basketball game
3568319,Everything is well. HM asked me if Selma could bring the kids over to seey dog. I told her any time
3568300,"AD spoke to HM.  HM stated that AP has trouble saying no to HC. HC didn't want to go to karate and AP told them to ask HM.  HM said no to HC and HC threw a fit.  HM told AP that if AP is consistent they won't throw a fit and asked AP not to give them a choice.  HC must attend karate.  AD suggested HM give AP some language to use consistently.  For example, she can say ""My answer is not going to change."" HM thought that was a good idea and would try that.  HM stated AP is still having trouble remembering to look at calendar.  Overall, HM is happy with AP and was thrilled to hear AP is also happy with placement."
3568294,Hm says AP now understands how serious it is to be vigilant about the foods brought into the house.  AP is adjusting well.  Previous AP is showing new AP the routine.
3568292,HM has returned to work full time.  AP is doing well taking care of both children.  HM has not let AP drive in the snow.  She is doing a bit better with driving but still needs practice.
3568287,"AD spoke with HM, she updated me with her cell and home numbers. HM says her placement is wonderful. She says the AP is fabulous. They get a long well and she is good with the kids. HM says she considered talking the AD job when it was available."
3568276,AD spoke to HD.  He and AP are interested in extending for 1 more year.  AD e-mailed them extension paperwork.
3568259,"AD called HMs work number and was successful in reaching her. HM says AP is doing well. He is active with the boys. The schedule and pay are good. HM says ap is not as good at the chores, dishes and laundry and he needs reminding sometimes."
3568253,HM very happy with Amel and have no issues in their 2nd year.  they will be sad to see her leave as she was one of their best Ap's.  Last AP - Emily will be visiting next month and both AP's will be able to spend some time together and with the boys.  HM reported they might be moving to Birmingham when new AP arrives. HF excited and nervous about new AP but they understand the program. Most likely they will have an overlap and Amel will train Tati.
3568251,Going well. Due mid-Feb with twins. All is well so far with Faith.
3568249,Good. They are planning on extending
3568246,Everything is going well.
3568245,"AD spoke with HM, wo says her AP is very nice and helpful. HD left for a four month stay in Russia. HF will miss him, they are happy to have the AP."
3568236,"HD got back to AD.  They are interested in extending with Ludo, but probably for less than 6 months.  They are thinking perhaps Ludo will need to end the end of July.  They will go ahead and sign up for a 6 month extension, and then terminate early if needed.  AD sent them all of the required paperwork."
3568232,"Very well.  HM is planning a vacation for herself, HC, and Amandine for early March - not sure where they are going yet."
3568230,AD spoke with HM. Everything is going great. No complaints or concerns at this time.
3568211,"HD got back to AD.  He said AP finally got her DL, and is taking class at LADO right now--thinks the class is in a level too easy for her, so AD will encourage AP to look into switching into a class where she will learn more."
3568210,Great. We love her.
3568201,Not so well ( see other Casper notes)
3568198,Good
3568197,Things are going fine
3568195,"AD spoke at great length with this HM, and she has been so pleased with her AP. She loves their relationship and feels the AP does a great job with her kids. She mentioned the driving incident, and she said she does not share the same sentiments as her husband who had talked about leaving APC due to our not paying the ticket mentioned in an earlier post. She said it was unfortunate, but the good news is that Alita has passed the written test and will take the driving test on Friday. She felt she needed the instruction to improve her driving. HM also had questions regarding when she should start thinking about looking for her new AP. AD mentioned the early match discount and told her she would reach out to the ME with some questions she may have."
3568193,This HM could not be more pleased with her AP. She said things are going really great and the APs English has improved immensely. She is very happy with the program.
3568192,Great.  AP has a wonderful personality and the kids love her.  AP is going to Florida in March with her boyfriend.  HF will be traveling to Florida in April for 2 weeks and will bring AP with her.
3568188,"HD feels that Melanie is having a harder time connecting with APs since her good friend left.  HD feels that Melanie is more mature and not looking to go to the clubs, but looking to do other things.  HD says that HF is trying to include Melanie in more activities that the HF is doing to help Melanie through this transition.  AD has offered to help AP pair up with other APs in the cluster."
3568185,HD got back to AD.  He said all is well.  They matched with a new AP from Germany this week for when Danna leaves.
3568182,"HM got back to AD.  She said all is well.  AP is taking more classes, and paying for them herself."
3568179,It was great to finally talk to host mom Mindy.  She informed me that dad was on his way to his deployment overseas and that she would be holding down the home front for sometime.  Laura continues to do well and Mindy is happy that she will be traveling with a friend to Hawaii and CA during her grace period month.  We discussed meeting for the APO once the new AP arrives in March.
3568177,"HM and I spoke a few times this month. They have been very frustrated with Louise and her lack of common sense.  I asked HM to have me come out for a mediation. HM feels this will not help because there are too many issues. HM reports they are not life threatening issues/concerns but just common sense things.  HM will send me weekly emails with the things Louise is or is not doing.     Most recently email:    Last night Louise helped make some tea for Elly (which was great) but then left all of the dishes in the sink instead of putting in the dishwasher (it was not full or running).  I came by later and loaded the dishwasher.   Then she packed lunches--during which time she cut the tops off strawberries and left them sitting in the middle of the (now empty) sink.  At 10pm they were still sitting there so I cleaned them out of the sink and rinsed the sink.  Louise was in bed by this time.  Next, I went into the laundry room to put folders in the kids backpacks and found the box from dryer sheets sitting on the utility tub ledge.  It was empty (Louise had used the last of it while doing laundry yesterday during the day).  The utility tub has a trash can underneath it (!)..yet the box sat out all day, was not throw away or recycled.  Louise has to go into the laundry room to pack snacks/water in backpacks, so she walked past it all evening.  Its still there this morning.    For the majority of the evening, Louise was sitting in the TV room with a blanket on her lap and playing on her iphone--so its not like she was ""working"" or doing chores, etc.  If Louise was my child, I would get on her case about this sort of stuff--in fact, I DO get on my kids case about this sort of stuff!  I tell them I'm not their maid and that they need to pick up after themselves.    But there are things like this almost on a daily (no joke) basis.  If I say something each time, it will get out of hand.  So many times I say nothing and just pick up the empty coke can or brush off the snack crumbs that were not cleaned up when the kids finished eating, etc.    We've had the conversation with her about picking up after herself and the kids (in fact, its on the list).  We've said--very plainly--that we already have 3 kids to pick up after, we don't want a 4th, and that we expect her to be another adult in the house...to take pride in where she lives, how the house looks, how the kids are dressed/hair brushed, etc.  I think she just simply does not care or notice--and I'm not sure how to change this.  Yesterday she tossed something into the kitchen garbage can and it fell back out and she walked away.  I was standing right there so I said, ""Louise, I think you missed the trash can"".  She came back and tried again, but the trash was full.  I actually had to say to her ""I think the can is too full for more trash--maybe it should be taken out"".  ugh.  Its something I would have to say to my own kids when they are trying to avoid being the one who has to take out the trash!  This is why I'm not sure reviewing the list is going to make a difference.  But we can try.  I asked Randy to suggest some dates and will let you know.  I think its important to provide these examples so you understand...I don't ring you up every time, obviously.  But yesterday provided some good examples.   Patty Cox (m) 586-817-5745"
3568176,HM reports all is going well with Paola. Her driving is good and she is good with her job responsibilities. HM reports she has been flexible and the kids really like her.  she has started school and her English is improving. She has made some good friends and gets out sometimes when not working but also spends some free time with the HF.
3568174,Everything is going well
3568165,HD thought it was great but we both just found out AP wants to go home. She is very homesick and there is no talking her out of it. She insists she wantsto be home by the end of Feb. AP will help HD in any way she can till he gets a new AP
3568161,Everything is going well.
3568160,All is still going well at the Dolsons!
3568159,All is going well. Nicole is quiet and keeps to herself most of the time. Told Cindy that I had a good conversation with Nicole and the education conflict and disappointment  seems to have gone away.
3568151,"She said everything is great.  No issues to discuss.  They just got home from Mexico but did not have a great time as they all came down with the flu.  They are still recovering.  She said it was hard to believe that she is already going home, but they are looking forward to their next au pair."
3568148,All is great with Misaki. They are going to Maui in Feb and will be bringing her with them. Yoko wanted Misaki's birthday.
3568146,Told Mimi that I was saving a Mamma Mia ticket for new AP and wanted to know if she was interested. She may go along with Kim Donati. Anxious for new AP but will really miss Ewa. Will schedule O/A once AP arrives.
3568144,Agnes is doing great. She is very smart and responsible. Heather has a new business and wanted to share her blog with me.
3568142,"Kim said they all love ""Nanny Nina"". She is awesome with the girls and like one of the family. I asked her if she had questions about extension billing and she said she understood fees and had not really paid attention to due date. She also questioned having 10 vacation days for Nina. I told her she inherits the APs remaining vacation days although former HF should have paid Nina for 2 days."
3568131,the boys are having a hard time transitioning to Triinu. Julian is especially having difficulty because he gets impatient with her not knowing English well enough to understand her. Vanessa has told Triinu not to take things he says personally but she still does. She is hoping things will improve.
3568129,"spoke with Teresa, all is going well"
3568123,great
3568121,Very Well.  They are very happy with Sara and enjoy having her in their home.  The boys are doing well.
3568120,Good.  Madison had surgery for her heart on January 17th and it went well.  Madison is home resting.
3568108,they are doing great with Selina
3568105,"Going well. They were a bit upset that they had to stress out about Charlotte's renewal back in Nov, as they did not hear back from HQ or me that everything was done and since they submitted so close to the deadline, they were upset that they had this worry. She voiced this to me this time around. Otherwise all is well."
3568100,Julia is leaving and she is debating with husband about what to do next. She wants to send kids to daycare and he wants an aupair. They may want a short term au pair that can go for 2-3 months after Julia leaves and before school starts.
3568097,"Great - HF loves this AP and she is doing well with their daughter. Working towards getting license for AP. Discussed recent difficulties at DMV, and host Mom has already encountered this several au pairs ago, and feel prepared to deal with it."
3568096,Jillian stated she continues to happy in her match. Natilia is doing a good job and the children seem to be happy. No concerns at this time
3568095,Good
3568088,Well- Darryl says- are taking a break after Mari leaves in Feb.  Wil revisit the AP idea this summer when they have more time to train the new AP and help her learn to drive.
3568080,Well. Hoping Elena takes classes soon!
3568077,HM is feeling better - things are going well with AP -off to a good start for the new year.
3568064,"Spoke with David, So far, he is really happy with Rebecca. She is working out for the family."
3568052,"Things are going fine. AP has 7 more weeks. HF said that initially they were steering away from having another AP, but now are rethinking that."
3568050,Good.  HM said all is well. They have had some frustrations with APs important documents both at the embassay and at the DMV.  AD referred HM to Scott as hopefully h can help guide them.
3568049,"Good, David is weathering the cold like us all."
3568045,HM said everything is good.  She said she is pregnant and due in April. Hm said she will have her 6 weeks maternity and HD is a teacher so he will be home with the baby and Laura will be with the 3 older kids. I said sounds great!
3568040,"Great, HF getting ready to sell house and move, maybe to WP area. Anna does a great job."
3568039,"HF moved here with AP 12/30. They are all adjusting but doing fairly well. AP has made a few friends, she went out on New Year's Eve w/another AP. Host dad is still in VA."
3568033,HF on vacation in Disney for the week.  HF  having a great time and happy to have missed the ice storm.  AP is enjoying seeing Disney
3568027,Very well. Things have improved for them 10 fold since the meeting with Laurie.
3568023,Very well. HF is happy with Malu's transition into their home. Ana left many 'directions' about Khloe's daly routine which has been helpful. Malu attended monthly meeting for January and met all of APC APs as well as 3 CC au pairs!
3568017,"Very well. Livia has been working out for them and they are happy to be extending. Livia has enjoyed a lot of vacation days over the holiday season, and this month the HF went away for the weekend with Leo. They are aware that they are granting Livia extra time off unless it is an official 'vacation day'."
3568009,HM says they are still very happy with Jules- she goes out on weekends and works hard with the kids and they could not be more pleased.
3568004,"Everything is great, HM I very happy with AP and she is hoping AP will extend the program  with her."
3567999,Hm and I spoke earlier this month and HM had some concerns with Mariana to report.  HM does not like the boyfriend she has and they had some concerns with her being honest.  HM reported that AP' keeps changing her mind on what she wants to do when she finishes. HF was thinking about breaking the match.  Mariana was going back to Mexico in January and I told HM to have a talk with her before she goes and when she comes back to have a fresh start.
3567990,AD reported things are ok with Jackie this month.  HD said his oldest girl has had some medical problems and has been in the hospital for a while with her breathing. He said Jackie has been very helpful and flexible. He wants another AP when she leaves but he can't afford one at this time.
3567986,HM reported they are having some issues with Erika and started the search for a new AP in June.  HM said Erika got a boyfriend and spends most of her time with him. They also have some other concerns about her being flexible and reliable. HM reported she will try to work it out with her first before she involves me.
3567981,Hm reported all is well with Nanny. She has no concerns this month. Driving is much better but they do limit the distance on snowy and icy days.  HM happy to have another AP in Grosse Pointe for Nanny to hang out with but sad they are in rematch already.
3567974,Hm reported all is well this month with Maria. NO concerns or issues. They will probably get another AP when she leaves. Told HM they can reapply anytime for free to start looking for a June arrival. They will miss her very much and said she is still a very good cook!
3567973,"Good, Tamara has been sick and traveling so dad and ap have been in charge."
3567969,"HF and AP have had a rocky start.  Day 5 AP called HM on the phone while caring for the kids and said she was having a heart attack. HM called 911. They went to the hospital and HM stayed with her until midnight.  Doctors did many many test and everything looked ok. Doctors feel it was a panic/anxiety attack. HF gave her day off next day. AD come over and had talk with all parties. AP reported that she is feeling a little better but was still tired. She told HF that she could work the next day. HF still tried to give her a less stressful day with the kids.  AD took AP to get her SS number a few days later. AP fell asleep in the chair while we were waiting.  Next day AP had an incident with the car and driving too fast and ran into a snow bank. She also got lost one day.  AD came over on week 2 and had lunch with her and the kids. HD reported she did a better job after the talk I had with her. However, 2 days later HD contacted AD and said they had 2 more incidents they wanted documented. #1. She allowed the 3 young kids into her room and she took her eyes off the 3 year old and she had a razor blade in her room that he got into and cut his finger pretty badly.  #2. AP took a bath with the 3 year old. When HD found out he asked the 3 year old if she was wearing a bathing suit and he said no. He asked him what she was wearing and he said ""hair"".   HD told AP that she is never to take a bath with the kids at anytime. They sat down with her after HM returned home and had a long talk with her and went through the host family handbook again.  HD was going to follow up with AD after their conversation."
3567959,"HM reported all is great with Lea. She appreciated that I canceled the last event as they live further away and they didn't want her AP driving in this weather. She is great with the kids, she is apart of the family and driving is good. She has been great with the kids having no school with winter snow.  No issues or concerns."
3567954,HM says the new AP is working out well so far and she seems pleased. I am going over this friday to meet both.
3567934,"Exchanged a lot of emails, but didn't get to talk with HM..  They did go to Ramapo orientation.  Marie will take a class there, but HPs are going to have to drive her since she is a non-driver.  Talking about extending already. Very happy with her."
3567933,HF reported all is well with Aleida. She is doing well with her schedule and routine. The kids are adjusting to her. She is not driving yet but HF is driving her to a ESL school. She can start driving when the snow goes away.  HM reported that she has some friends and they will pick her up to go out.
3567929,"Good!  HM refers to Anna as ""a GREAT au pari!""  Hectic holidays, glad to be winding down.  Anna is taking both classes this term - one at Ramapo and another Niagara Falls weekend tour.  Inseparable with Julia;  they have busy social lives.  All is great!"
3567924,Everything is good. We have a pretty good communication. The only two things I've struggled with is cleaning. Youngest still is not using potty well and Melina is not cleaning after him enough. The oldest wants to do more arts and crafts. AD suggests seting aside Arts and Crafts on certain days.
3567923,HF reported all is well with Tereza. They love her like their own daughter. She is great with Jon and has a great group of friends.  Driving is good and they have no issues or concerns at all.  HM thanked me for canceling the AP meeting last week due to the weather. She did not want the AP to drive in the snow.
3567913,HF contacted AD this month and said they had a big fight with Vanessa and asked me for my help. I told HD I would like to come out to the house and gave HD some dates. HD contacted AD back and said they are trying to work it out themselves and appreciated my assistance but would like to see if they can work and will contact me next week if they need my help.  HD reported that Vanessa has withdrawn from her duties and spends her free time in her room and does not really interact with them anymore.
3567905,HM reports all is well with Nele. They really like her and she fits into their family nicely. She is a good driver and does great with the busy hockey schedule. The extended family likes her also.  They have been talking about vacation as AP would like to travel with some friends in the next few months.
3567904,"Things are going well. AP's grandfather just passed away and HM had some questions about her traveling back to Europe, including if she is able to travel. AD confirmed AP's valid visa with multiple entries through July 2014."
3567897,HM reports all is well with Elissa. She has her court date in February. As of now her Insurance company has not said anything about the DWI.   Elissa continues to do her job and does it well.  She will return home in May and may consider coming back for the summer on her travel VISA. HF will probably not continue with the program after Elissa leaves as the kids are getting older.
3567888,"AD spoke to HM Bettina on 1/29. All is going very well so far. HF has additional help to cross train. HM and AP know each other through mutual friend Cheryl, so the transition should go smoothly. AP is learning the routine to care for Kyle. AO will be 2/4 at 8:00pm."
3567870,HM has no issues with childcare but the household duties don't get down all the time. HM was sick for a week and wished that AP could have stepped just a little temporarily.
3567866,"Good - Sam continues to do a good job, and keeps Thomas happy!"
3567857,"Good. Very well. We had a meeting with Elena, to check-in and we decided to 6 months."
3567855,"Stacey called me back, She said are you calling regrading the email Marianna sent us? I said no, I wasn't aware she sent you a email. HM said she sent me a email about extending with us which we don't want. Hm said was is the purpose for your call? I said just wanted to check in. She said I am very busy. I thanked her for the call back. I told her if she needed anything to contact me at her convenience."

3567814,"Good - HM is pregnant, due in May - will be on maternity leave until labor day, doesn't want to extend w/ current AP - interested in a more infant-oriented (possibly IS) AP next time - but will target mid-August for arrival.  In the meantime, AP is good - great with older HC, OK with younger but very creative with older, doesn't always follow instructions closely - thinks communication may be difficult but things are good"
3567810,Good - Elicia is doing a great job and really working at a strong relationship with the older ones.
3567809,"HM said the placement was about the same- AP had traveled some and HM introduced HC to new nanny, which made a ""dramatic difference in Tessa's attitude and demeanor..."" even HC's teacher noticed a change. AD asked if HM could ever help in any way and to please call on her if help was ever needed in the future."
3567804,Things have started off well. HM says that AP is developing a good relationship with the boys. AP is adjusting well. She has met some of the other APs in the area.

3567783,"Hmom reports that things are o.k. with AP Zuzanna, she is providing good childcare but has a boyfriend, Hmom feels as if the AP sometimes gets distracted by the boyfriend and gets sidetracked.  Hmom says AP spends all of her free time with the boyfriend.  Example:  HF went to michigan for Holidays, AP did not want to leave for Mi. when HF was leaving because she wanted to be with boyfriend so, Hmom bought a train ticket for AP so that she could stay and spend more time with her boyfriend but still be able to join HF for Christmas day. AP arrived in Mi. late  Xmas eve. Christmas morning AP reports that her boyfriend is on his way to pick her up and take her back to chicago.  Hmom was very upset with AP by this decision and said to AP ""You haven't even been here for 24 hours and you're already going home it's Christmas Day?""  Hmom was very upset that she spent $70-80 on a train ticket so that AP could spend more time with her boyfriend before Xmas only to find out from AP that she was leaving the next morning to spend more time with him and not with their family.   Hmom says AP will be taking her 2nd weekend class in April. They will be going to Mexico over their Spring break and taking AP with them."
3567765,HD says the placement is going well with both APs.
3567761,Spoke with Shari. Things are going well with Caroline. She injured her back the other day and had to go to the emergency room. She has a pinched nerve and is in a lot of pain.

3567711,HM stated still have to remind AP for some things but getting better. Driving is just okay and not real comfortable having AP drive the kids. HM allows Ben to drive with AP very locally only.
3567698,Met with HM Leigh and Maira for the A/O. Reviewed schedule and expectations. Leigh said that things are going well so far. They are going to hold off on driving b/c of the snow.
3567675,"HM contacted AD this month asking me if she could break the match with Cleo early. They had a big fight last week. HM reports that they dont use Cleo for 45 hours and they are flexible with her schedule. HM reported one night when she was suppose to be off at 11:00pm, AP was texting them at 11:05pm where they were as she had plans to go out. HF was very upset about this this. They also reported that this is not the 1st time. I told HM that AP did not request her flight home and if they wanted to end the match she would only be eligible for a program credit of 1 month toward a new AP, however, HF was not getting another AP. HM said she would get back to me with their final decision.  I told HM that I would like to see them work things out because they had a good 1 year and 5 months together."
3567674,AP is excellent.  HM enjoyed spending the holidays with AP in Florida
3567671,"Hmom reports that things are ok with AP Adele.  Hmom says they wish AP would be more communicative with them. Example: Toilet was not working in APs bathroom and AP did not tell them, she was using another toilet instead.  When Hmom found about the broken toilet and asked the AP about it, AP didn't have much to say about it.  I suggested to Hmom that she have a sit down discussion with AP about the concerns she has. Hmom also wishes AP would be more mindful of things.  Example: Hdad took kids and AP out for a quick bite on friday evening.  Everyone ordered burgers but AP ordered most expensive thing on the menu a $28. entree."
3567665,HD stated so far so good. He felt bad for AP because baby came down with a virus and baby was fussy on Monday.

3567657,HM and HD and I have been in communication with each other all month. AP's mother in Germany had surgery and was put into a comma as she had an brain aneurysm during surgery. AP and HF reported that all went well and they woke her up after a week. She has some memory lose which was expected.  She knows who people are but she forgot Mandy was in the USA as an AP.  HF knows she will not extend. HF not sure if they will continue with another AP or not as the kids are getting older.
3567652,"HM reports things are going well. AP was in Czech last month visiting her family. They really like her and most likely sponsor her longer on a Student VISA or she might get married. The kids like her, she does a good job and no issues or concerns."
3567651,HM reports things are going well with Jeni. I gave HM instructions on how to reapply to the program for their next AP.  HF will bring someone in July. They want European for the good driving.  They are not sure if they will have an overlap or not. Most likely yes but had some concerns from last transitions with 2 Au Pairs.
3567648,Everything is good with  Genny. She is happy and has made a few new friends in the area. She said the kids are nice to her for the most part.  She has been keeping them busy during the winter months and schools being closed. Driving is good with their big van. HM said they are in the middle of hockey districts so they are very busy and she has been nice helping with getting kids to their locations when needed.
3567646,HM reports all is going well with Aby. She is great with the kids and is doing her best to manage all 4 during January with so many snow days. she has been great with welcoming new AP's in the area. They will probably not get another AP when she leaves.
3567645,HM reported that after a few months of some growing pains that things are going very well. HM did not know it would take so long with an Au Pair.  She said her driving is good and that she drives the kids daily now even in the snow.  She has friends and is going out when not working.
3567643,"Hmom reports that everything is great with AP Klara, they absolutely adore her and feel she has truly become apart of their family. They are taking her with them to Hawaii over their spring break.  Mom also reports that AP was delighted when Mom asked her if she wanted to go to Disney on ice with the rest of the family.  Mom says AP has always wanted to see disney on ice but never had as a kid. All is well."
3567642,HM reports they are very happy with Lauren. She is great with the kids. They did notice recently she has been a little sad. They don't know if it is the weather or what.  I told HM to talk with her and see how she is feeling. They are talking about the 2nd year. We spoke about the deadline
3567596,HD says they are doing great.  They love AP and find her to be so helpful and easy to live with.  HD says store is going great!
3567558,"Hmom reports that all is well with AP and her childcare.  They have had to discuss with AP the amount of mileage AP tends to put on the car.  They suggested to Tami that she shouldn't have to be the only one to drive, that friends should carpool. Hmom says AP is open and receptive when issues come up and have to be discussed."
3567539,"This HM reached out once she heard the ADs dad had passed with very caring words. She also said that things are going very well with Wendy. She said that she knows that her family is a lot to take with 4 young kids, so they do what they can to help Wendy out. She also felt bad because Wendy was very excited to start her coursework, but it was likely canceled due to the bad weather. This family is very caring toward their AP and really tries to make a tough childcare assignment easier as best they can."
3567531,"Great, ap is in Ireland right now."
3567527,AD has been in contact with this HM several times regarding some education issues. AD confirmed with her yesterday that it appears that all is fine with the APs education requirement. Things are going well other than the stress of getting the education submitted in time for the AP to apply for her extension.
3567525,Good. HM said all is well.  Nothing new to report.  Hm is trying to find time to to market her book.
3567520,"Because this is a brand new placement, the HM does not really have a full assessment yet. So far things are going fine. We will meet this week for the HFO. Questions below are not yet applicable."
3567519,"AD spoke with the HM a couple of times in January due to the APs arrival being delayed. This HM is always so gracious. Though they had to scramble for care for their kids, she understood that it couldn’t be helped. Because this is a brand new placement, the HM does not really have a full assessment yet. We will meet next week for the HFO. Questions below are not yet applicable."
3567514,Great!  We will definitely be one of your easy families - AP is great - knows she has a great gig but is good at everything - HM currently not working but looking for employment as psychologist - HF recently returned from 2 years in England - oldest HC is still there in boarding school - will finish HS there but return to US for college
3567505,Good.  HM said AP had been sick and needed insurance info to go to the doctor.  AD provided the information she had.  HM said AP never received the email from UHC with her ID #.  AD gave her customer service # and let her know that had she not created an account within 14 days of the initial email AP would have received a second email with the ID# in it.
3567489,"Good, they just got back from New Orleans and are trying to get the driving permit. She failed the written the first time, Told her to go back and she can take it 3 times in one visit."
3567480,everything is great - we love antonia - we're happy to have a new ad who's closer (though we loved denise) - all is well
3567455,"Really well, though AP's first day was yesterday. HM said AP has ""lots of patience"" and that Braden seems to really respond well to AP. HM stated that he does better with AP than her. HM feels that AP's English is coming along very well and there really haven't been any problems with understanding her."
3567454,Very well. HM thinks that goria is great with the kids and that is the most important for them. They would like to extend with Giorgia but HM knows that AP also has other plans. She would like to study here. HP will talk with her on Friday and ask I she is going to stay with them for at least 6 more months.
3567453,Everything is well. HM is going back to work next month. She feels comfortable leaving their son with Clara.
3567452,All is going well. She has no issues or concerns. She is currently looking for her replacement AP as she says that it takes her a while to match so she is getting a head start. Current AP is doing well and she is happy with her.
3567449,Very well. Everything is good.
3567443,HF likes Amir a lot. he does a good job with the kids.
3567440,"Everything's great!  We couldn't be happier!  AP is a perfect blend of social, outgoing, but very much a part of our family and engaging - on and off duty - with HC!"
3567438,Everything is well.
3567436,"HF is happy with Moe. She does a good job, she is very god with the kids too"
3567429,Everything is well. Thilda was sick last week but she is much better now
3567428,everything is great - HF realizes how very lucky they are to have this AP - she is warm and loving with HC and very much a part of the family - they just returned from Colorado where HD was teaching and AP was a huge help with HC

3567421,Everything is well with Loic.
3567403,"everything is going well, HM and AP had few issues few weeks ago, but right now they are all getting along and happy with each other."
3567395,Placement is going well.  Dominick seems to be fitting in well with the family.  Concerned about letter for SS card.  I told them that they do not need AuPairCare letter anymore.  I told them they still need the letter for the DMV and sent one per email and through the mail.
3567392,"HM says that she is getting ready to transition back to work in one month. She says that she is working with AP to make sure that she feels comfortable with two kids and multitasking. HM says that they may be getting cameras in the house once she is back to work. She says that AP was concerned that they were getting them because they don't trust her, but HM says that this is not the case and they would like to  have them more for both AP and kids protection. She says that AP feels better about it now that it was discussed. She says that at the end of February AP will not be able to drive since her international driver's license will expire and she is not able to get her VA license until she turns 19. She says that they are working out a plan so that AP doesn't feel isolated."
3567366,Spoke with Kristen. She said that things are going well with Jasmine. She is such a joy and she is like a big sister to her daughter. She is exceptional. Ap still has not received her SSC and this is stopping her from not getting a drivers license.
3567364,"HM reached out to AD b/c AP is having a family emergency and she wants to go home for 1 week.  AD completed DOS updates for HF and AP, and let them know its fine for AP to travel in her 1st year as long as she has all of her paperwork in order.  AD also gave HM a few ideas for filler childcare, as she needs help for the week AP will be gone."
3567358,"Things are going well except for AP's phone use . She seems to have her phone with her all the time when she is on and off duty and HM is concerned she is distracted while on the job. AP asked HF to download several international chat apps, etc. onto the phone which the HF did thinking that she would only use them when she was off duty. HF and I agreed that we would discuss this more during her arrival orientation on Monday, 2/3."
3567350,Sarah can't believe Lea will be leaving soon. She has worked out for the family. They won't be needing another ap because kids are much older now.
3567345,Spoke with Ritsuko. She said things are good with Camilla. Everybody is really busy. Camila will be going to school every Tuesdays and Thursdays. She will be going to Berkeley and they support her for that.
3567342,"Thing are going well. Family is getting sad that AP is leaving, but is also excited to welcome their new au pair. I spoke with HM about our new buddy program and asked if they would like me to assign HF Heinlein's AP as her buddy - they said yes."
3567341,Fran said they are doing great.  She said they will miss Eli terribly but they've kept in touch with their other au pairs so they think they will with Eli too.
3567338,"Great - we're definitely in the groove - she engages with the kids, helps me prepare their dinner - AD caught Hm between rehearsals for school variety show she is chairing - talked about next year and HF has decided they don't need an AP after this AP leaves in July - but will always be a great source of referrals"
3567336,Spoke with Cynthia. She said things are good with Lilly. She will start her classes on tonight. Her classes will be on Wednesdays and Saturdays.
3567335,great-- boys are really enjoying each other and already AP has helped middle schooler focus on homework.
3567331,Thing are going well. AP's finger is healing and she just received bill from Hospital. HF asked that I reach out and help AP with that which I will do this week.
3567324,"Spoke with Jami briefly. She was in between meetings at her work but said she can't complain, things are good with Natalia"
3567320,"Spoke to HD. Everything is going very well. He had questions about the extension program. They have asked AP to stay a second year and she seems receptive. HD said AP told him it would cost her $3K to extend and I told him that isn't true. I explained the fees, including $367 DOS fee. I suggested that they ask her to give them an answer by March 1."
3567316,Spoke with Vanessa. She said Lisa is doing better. She is getting ready and is looking forward to her mom coming for a visit.
3567314,Everything is terrific.  They love Steffi and she loves them.  Llbby is going to put on a tax information meeting in March for all au pairs.
3567313,"AP is now caring for the baby as well as the two boys and HM says she's doing a wonderful job. HM went back to work in mid January when baby was 3 months old. Only slight problem is that AP had a falling out with her friend, Pavlina, and HM knows that she's very sad about that. I thanked her for letting me know. HF and AP plan to extend a second year."
3567286,"Things have hit a good stride and the relationship is really good right now. AP only has 2 weeks until she leaves for Texas for her grace period. HF is taking their time on the new AP search. The ""need"" is less because HM is home from work, so they are waiting for the perfect candidate. HF has also decided that for heir next AP, they will get a 3rd car."
3567248,"Things are going really well. AP's program end is in July, and AP has asked HF if she can stay for part of her grace period, and they have agreed to that. HF is still considering whether or not to get another AP. They are going to be moving, so there is some questions as to space, etc. Reminded family of the early match discount and April 9th deadline."
3567222,Amy said everything is great.  She said Galina really enjoyed the make your own pancake place we visited for the meeting. She said they are taking a trip right before the big move so they will probably leave TN around July 1 and be settled and start working in DC around August 1.
3567213,"Things are going well HF is disappointed that AP is leaving middle of next month, but they are dealing with it. I asked if they had any more question about the billing, and HM thought that HF might, but he is away on business at the moment. Let HF know that their incoming AP has been matched with a buddy."
3567204,Well.  Angie has a boyfriend.  She spends a lot of time with him.  She has never really spent a lot of time with the family when she isn't working.  Kate encourages Angie to go out when she's off.  Angie is a pretty private person - she's not an introvert but likes time to herself.  It works for them but Kate admitted that she might want to look for a German au pair next time. Someone more organized and a better driver.   They love Angie though.
3567203,Things are going well. HFhad some questions regarding A duties specifically as they related to doing the dishes and wiping off the counters in the kitchen. I addressed these when we spoke.
3567177,"HM Yuko returned AD's calls, after AD finally mentioned having to send out DOS letters.  HM could not get off the phone fast enough, it seemed.  HM answered every question before AD even finished asking it.  HM confirmed that match is 100% compliant.  AD congratulated HM on next AP (with another agency... she will only match with Japanese APs).  AD reminded AD that she will be calling again for next month, and that DOS demands phone contact.  HM said that she understood."
3567171,very well-- much more mature AP then previous APs she takes initiative and has connected with all four children!  OI scheduled for Fri Jan 31
3567170,Fine.  Aurore's grandmother died recently and she is not happy about the cold weather.  She loves getting outside.  Iris asked me to talk with Aurore to gauge how she's doing.  I did and she is fine.  I let Iris know she's happy.  She has connected with the other Aurore who just recently arrived.  The girls are going to get together this weekend.
3567169,"AD spoke with HM Anne when she was at work.  She confirmed that match is 100% compliant, and that AP Tabby is ""doing great"".  Tabby is back at school, and ""everything has a good rhythm to it and we're very happy!"""
3567160,Pretty well.  Jen said she needs to sit Veri down and talk with her about being in charge.  She is not very strict with the girls.  Jen has come home a number of times and the girls have not done their homework yet.  That is part of her job description.  Other than that things are going well.  Jen couldn't talk much because she was at work and really busy.  Overall things are fine.
3567157,well- although noticing tension that having a family member serve as an AP-- AP is a bit passive aggressive-- encouraged frank communication so that she can address issues and make sure there are no misunderstandings
3567152,"Good, he said we have been giving Grape extra time to do laundry and house chores and it has been working well."
3567142,great-- really enjoys HM family and has made great friends with other APs
3567089,"HM Katie returned AD's call; they have recently returned from trip to Israel with AP.  They had a great time, and AP did a good job getting teenage HC up and out each day.  They stayed at Notre Dame in Jerusalem, and took ""thousands"" of pictures.  Match 100% compliant."
3567088,See below for January contact.
3567085,Talked to HM who stated that things are good. She also added that Daniela is great.

3567040,"HM had very little time to talk, but said she had no concerns."
3567033,HD says all is going well with AP. They don't have any concerns. Have adjusted schedule with both kids in school and working out well. Looking for new AP in February.
3567021,AP and HM are home today because we have no school they call me to check the schedule for class at Pitt.
3567015,Very well.  Nili is very happy with Asli. She said she is sweet and very good with the children.  She is anxious to better her english and make friends.  She has started a class.  I asked Nili if she has her own phone yet and asked her to text the number to me.  Asli is sick right now with a cold.  Nili is taking care of her.
3567012,Very good.  Tina does a great job
3567007,Good.  HM is happy with AP.  HF and AP plan to extend together
3567005,Very good.  HM says AP is not extending.  AP is missing her boyfriend.  HF will re-apply for another AP
3567001,Spoke with Hm and everything is good. Just returned from vacation and has been busy.
3567000,"Good, nothing new to report."
3566999,
3566994,Great.  HM feels that AP has really gotten used to the schedule already.  HM let AD know that HF will be taking a vacation in March and the AP will be staying home.  HM wants AP to make lots of friends and let AD know that AP is already interested in taking a class on a weekend.
3566991,HM has initial concerns over the AP and is faced with a deadline for work.  AD explained that it takes  a couple of weeks for an AP to get comfortable with the house schedule and the kids routine.  HM wants things to work out and is willing to be more patient.
3566988,HM is happy with how things have progressed with AP.   HM is glad that AP has met friends in the area and AP seems happy.
3566971,"All is status quo, Hf has no questions or concerns. Ap is still not getting out socially as they had hoped, they want her to have a good year. But feel she is in control of taht as well"
3566958,AD spoke with HM. HM apologized for not calling back sooner.  AD mentioned that AP wanted to extend but that her school wouldn't be done in time.  HM stated they don't really care for AP because she's a know it all but HM and HD discussed it and they want to extend because AP is great with HC and is very responsible and good at taking direction so they are willing to do another year.  HF told AP she needed to decide by end of month so HF can start looking for new AP if necessary. AD mentioned early bird discount and will email extension information and deadlines to HM. HM stated AP switched classes so she would be finished with everything by the deadline.
3566957,did APO and things are going well - they all seem relaxed and tell me that Estefania is good with the baby.
3566951,AP and HF are working better this month.  The confusion about the schedule and chores to be completed by end of day have stopped due to a whiteboard and sticker chart.  See more info below HM said AP asked if HF wanted to extend with AP.  HM says HD and AP do not agree on a few things and have a a few personality conflicts.  HM will discuss with HD about extending.  Hm admits to AD it would be easier as AP knows kids and family routine and there would not be an adjustment period
3566948,"Everything is fine with AP, HFM still struggling.  Call the HFD in Feb. if she is not back yet.  She should be bakc later in the month though."
3566936,HF wants to extend for a second year.  There is some concern over the fact that AP lost her Visa.  HF is paying for AP to travel home to see her family in her first program year.  HF wants to make sure AP will be able to reenter the country without having proof of Visa.
3566924,APO went pretty well.   HM likes Ning but she is quiet and her English is not strong. Her driving is ok. She has been driving the kids to and from school and branching off further.  she has made a friend and gets out with her when she is not working.  HM would like for her to get into some kind of English class sooner than later.
3566923,"Great.  Cold.  HM says cooking slightly improved.  AD suggested if cluster has a recipe contest, where each family submits one easy recipe.  HM loved this idea."
3566918,APO went very well.  They really like Khem with the kids. HM reported her driving is very good and she really engages with the HF and kids.  She has made 1 friend and gets out with her.   HM would like to keep her 2 year but realizes she is already on her 2nd year.
3566916,Phoebe has been great.  They have been spending a lot of time skiing in PA.  They are going to St. Louis in a few days and know to reach out to the AD there if anything comes up.
3566913,HM and I spoke about Steffi and how wonderful she is. They would like for her to extend longer. HM offered AP to go back to Germany for a few weeks in the summer if she stayed. They also offered to pay for her father to come to the USA during the summer months. They are going to discuss it more in February and March.
3566910,"All is fine. This is her last few weeks. She is glad to be going home. She is not sure what she will do when she goes home, but she is pretty much done being an AP, she says."
3566909,All is just fine with Carla and they know she is excited to take her weekend business class at Georgtown.  Things are very busy with life and they are excited for Juliana's arrival.  Briefly discussed need for APO two weeks from her arrival in home.
3566893,"well. Judy has been out of town for the last 2 weeks for work. Things have been crazy, busy in the home. Svjena is taking classes in the city on Sundays. She has been very helpful with the kids. Svjena is now settled downstairs in her redone room. Kids and H ost mom all had a stomach virus. Everyone is feeling better now."
3566892,"HM, AP and AD were talking a lot this month about extending, Canadian VISA process and 2nd year VISA process.  AP wants to stay but she also needs to go back in July to see her family.  After many emails and conversations AP decided to return home and HM is Not happy!  I tried to explain the the HM that if the AP is not 100% on board with extending that it is best they end it on a good note after 1 year.   There have been too many AP's who get bored and tired on their 2nd year and more problems occur."
3566886,HM reported all is gong well with Melisa.  They are thinking about extending with her but not sure if she wants to stay with them or in Michigan. They are going to talk about it next month.  HM said she is very good with the kids.
3566881,"AD spoke to HD.  HD stated everything is good. AP is industrious, motivated, does a good job, HC likes her, solid and huge improvement from last AP.  AD and HD discussed details of getting NJDL. HD said he and AP would discuss it and decide what they want to do."
3566872,AD spoke with HM. everything is great and AP seems very happy. HF and AP talk all the time.  HM's biggest concern was that HM and AP did not receive email about new insurance and HM stated that several of the other APs had questions about the new insurance and they were told to ask their HF's. AD is unsure of who told APs to do this and what the specific questions were.  AD told HM if they had any questions to ask me and AD will either provide info or find out who they should speak with.  HM stated AP wasn't sure where to take classes.  AD stated I had already emailed information to AP and would send that info to HM as well.  HM asked if she could be sent all the same info as AP because sometimes AP doesn't realize the importance of the info.  AD asked HM the best time to contact and HM stated daytime on her cell phone is best.  646-685-7933.
3566848,"Great , we are going to extend. Jess is going to a weekend course in February to complete her credits."
3566847,"We are thiking of extending .  AD will send information , but offered guidance verbally.  No complaints."

3566826,Adrienne has decided they will be done with the program. HM is cutting he hours and her son will be in half day school and they would only need about 15 hours of coverage.
3566821,"ok, not great, her husband is not happy with Laura and therefore the program. I talked to Suzie about trying to find a really great Ext AP for Mar that could excite them about the program. she said that would help!! I sent out an EM to RM's and AD's to try and find two great Ext AP's for March!!"
3566815,HM shared AP is doing well in her opinion.  Shared she is caring for her chiid in an appropriate way and that she seems to have fun and is positive.  No concerns.
3566814,"Things are going ok. HF had some questions about taxes which I answered. They didn't know that APs owed tax, let them know that typically they do and they should double check forms they are using with their CPA. Encouraged them to send their AP to the tax meeting in March."
3566800,Hm shared that all is well.  Shared how they can't believe how fast the time has gone by and shared how they are thinking about the transition with another AP.  HM shared how the AP has been such a part of their life it will be tough for them all.
3566793,HM shared that things are okay.  Shared that things are progressing as best as they can.  Shared there is nothing to report at this time.
3566790,"HM shared that things are okay.  Shared there are ups and downs but, they are trying to communicate better and make things clear for each other.  No concerns at this time to spk of shared the HM."
3566788,HM jokingly shared that she and the AP's biggest complaint is the crazy cold weather in NY.  They are happy disclosed the HM.  They couldnt have asked for a better experience.  No concerns.
3566784,HD shared quickly that things were going well and there were no concerns to spk of at this moment.  No assistance needed by AD at this time.

3566753,Good. HF and AP are in Hawaii having a great time!!
3566752,"Ok. HM called to let me know that things are a little rocky with AP and HFs youngest. HM says that their daughter is extremely sensitive. AP seems to always want to have the last word. HM says to her that sometimes you just need to let it go. And to not argue with the 5yr old. HF does not want 5 yr old to get away with things but pick and choose your battles. HM was simply telling me in case AP came to me. We had an event on Sunday and HM thought maybe AP would talk to  me, but AP did not come but when I spoke to her she said things were good and did not mention any concerns."
3566738,"good so far-except for the problem with the computer. Hopefully, he will get it back soon."
3566731,good
3566727,"HM shared they are all doing well and happy.  Shared they are struggling with the snow but, looking forward to a down south visit soon she joked.  No concerns shared."
3566718,"Thing are going okay/well. Overall HF is happy with AP, but HM mentioned a few incidents that have taken place since AP's arrival that have been difficult but she hopes after their conversations with AP are resolved. First, HM noted AP wasn't as helpful on their vacation as they had hoped. They felt AP treated it as her own vacation and not work and while the HF was very attentive to their children since it was a family vacation, they still felt she could have helped out more. After they returned they had a meeting and AP got he message and things have been much better. Second, AP was in a minor accident with the car that caused a bit of damage. HF understands accidents happen, but the accident happened when the AP left the daughters ballet class to run to a friends house and wasn't able to return to pick up the daughter. HM was disappointed AP left and feel like these are basic things she shouldn't have to request of the AP when she is working. But, overall, things are going well and the children are responding great and they are really happy she is part of their family."
3566715,Laura says things are not ideal but they are all talking and trying to keep things aired. their concern is that she does not take initiative in her work life or her personal life. HM says she is really a nice person but she is draining to the family with her emotions. talked to the HM about making sure they are comfortable with the match and deciding what to do before they come to the 6 months so they don't loose out on any money.I will take AP out for coffee to coach and see if she is too isolated and really wants to be part of the program.
3566708,HF think AP is doing very well and HM feels very comfortable.
3566707,"Thins are going well, HF is hoping AP will ext with them."

3566684,"AD spoke with James- he says he was unaware there was an ongoing issue with Juju's cell phone (3 months of broken microphone- able to text only) and that she was expected to be at the monthly meetings. AD stressed that it is in the contract that he and Victoria signed and that this has been an ongoing issue for their current AP and their former AP.  AD expressed that she understands that they live far from the rest of the cluster, but transportation 1x per month is part of the program.  AD expressed that she went over this at length at Juju's AO that he was not present for.  James says he will speak with Victoria- was unaware of monthly meetings he says."
3566673,Well- Carol is a big help says Luke.
3566669,"David said Lucia seems to be making friends now and adjusting well.  She seems happier. HD wants to wait and see if it is just an adjustment issue but Adriana is not really focused on t he kids and the family , he notes. she is all about her social life and making friends.  David discussed this at length with this AD. HE is not ready to rematch but is wondering if this will work out.  HD plans to have a weighty discussion with au pair Adriana and explain what they are unhappy about and hopes she will ""step up "" to the challnege.  Everyone is adjusting."

3566604,"AP is doing well with HF and HC. HM is a little concerned that AP doesn't want to drive and is not very outgoing with friends. Is helping her find school that would fit with their schedule, since she will probably have to drive her."

3566569,Great.  HM is annoyed AP received a full scholarship to Julliard and has decided not to accept it.  AP doesn't feel that AP understands what a wonderful opportunity this is for him.  HM would like AD to call AP.
3566563,"Great.  HM is thrilled that the old AP came from France to stay for 2 weeks.  Both APs are getting along very well.  HM and AD talked about having current AP extend for another year.  HM said that there were some small concerns that she wanted to address with AP without scaring her away.  AD advised HM to discuss things in an open manner.  An example is that if HM writes something down for the girls to do, AP may say we did not have time to get to it."
3566550,Very well.  AP is feeling better since being sick. HM and AD talked about extending for another year.  HM wanted to know what needed to be completed prior to extending.  AD explained that AP's education needs to be completed before the extension process can begin.
3566541,John said family is very happy with Luisa and that he feels like he has a 22 year-old daughter.
3566540,HM is very happy with the experience she had with APC.  HM thanked AD for all her time and effort in helping her family.  HM is excited to begin the next chapter with their AP staying with them on a student visa.

They do not want a transition right now.  HM shared that they have to accept that the AP is young, immature, and lacks intiative.  They have spken to her several times and there continues to be no desire to change.  HM refuses to have AD address the issues with the AP.   HM shared that she knows now how to interview better her next AP.  HM is putting her children first and will deal with the AP's issues."
3565022,"HM called me back, she said everything is going well with Ceci. They were wondering when her last day with them is? I said looks like July 15th. Pip asked when they could go back into FR to start looking. I said anytime they want, they just need to go in and reapply to get access to FR. I also said some HF like to have the AP's overlap for a week or so, that way the former AP can help get the new AP settles and it is a nice transition for the family."
3565019,Had nice talk with Erin who said that she is going to have a talk with Jessy as she sees some things starting to slip.  I gave her some suggestions on how to do it and writing lists etc.  They like her a lot but she needs to pick up the pace a little and be more helpful
3565017,had nice talk with Arezou who had just come in from working late.  Things are great and they had a guest who is one of Sarah's friends stayed over last night.  They would love her to extend but they think she will go back to Germany to start her school
3565013,HM says all is well and AP is doing great.
3565011,"Very well shared the HM. HM shared how there are no concerns to speak of.  HM shared how they are so appreciative of the AP's character, positive attitude and energy.  HM disclosed there is nothing more important to her than this personality trait for her and her family."

3565002,"Busi hit a fire hydrant and we have talked a lot.. the family is very upset. She didn't tell the Hf until the next morning. We are talking about the continuation for Busi as a driver, the Hf is concerned."
3564997,Placement is going well. HF is happy. Told HF to consider a creating connections party and HF said they will keep it in mind.
3564986,Great. HM's mother arrived from Serbia and will provide childcare for a few months. HM's Mother will be staying up to six months to help with her grandkids.  HF will be back. AP was able to extend with a family in Seattle. Otherwise things are well.

3564968,"Good....she did want to ask me about the meetings.  She said some are on school nights and too far away for Izumi. I explained every AP has different schedules and from many areas so that is why try to vary the days and locations. HM said oh ok that makes sense, thanks for explaining that."
3564967,Good.  It was a hard change after 2 years with last AP.  Tammy is doing a good job and getting better all the time.  Kids are adjusting well

3564907,HF and AP ended their match back in August. AP is no longer in their home.
3564904,APO went pretty well. HM said Patricia is very sweet and kind but she is also very quiet. HM said her family is loud and fun and if she is quiet like this it won't work. I suggested to HM to give it some time as she is learning her place. They have a Nanny also and she is still figuring out her role and duties. HM did report that they went up North right after she arrived and she was very quiet but then did have a fun day out snowmobiling. HM wants her to talk more to the older girls. She is good with the 2 younger boys. I gave HM recommendation on how to get her talking/interactcing to the girls more.
3564895,"HM and I spoke a few times this month.  HM is not happy with Claudia in the way she wants to have an employee /employer relationship. HM said AP told HM that she does not want to go above and beyond with any of her duties. She said she won't be flexible with her hours.  HM reported the took her to florida at Christmas, gave her $200 bonus, paid for new car for her after the accident, gave her gas money even when they were in Florida.  She did say she is good with the girls but HM would to start searching for a new AP to arrive in May/June. HM is thinking about letting her go early.

3564788,Ginny took some time to get back to me. She said things are going okay. There were a lot of tears last month. Katharina was really homesick. SHe is hanging out with a lot of other APS and she is getting some strength from them.

3564759,HM called me back and said that things with Edoardo are going great. He is a pleasure to have around and they enjoy his presence very much.
3564749,"H told me that so far things are going very well. They just moved in their new home and is a bit caotic but Maria is helpful and is learning fats. HM will go back to work on 2/10, so she has time to train her."
3564740,Everything is going well. HF is starting to think about their next AP since current AP's placement ends June 3. AD sent repeat HF discount and application information.
3564732,Everything is going great for HF.  no concerns at this time.
3564731,Everything is going good for HF.  HM says AP got her driver lcense and is driving and doing well so far.  HM is starting to interview other APs and is looking at a German AP.

3564723,Everything going great for HF and AP.  No concerns at this time.
3564719,Everything going good with HD. No concerns.
3564714,"Laura said that Jennifer is a very diplomatic young lady who has a great deal of patience, much more than she herself when it comes to the kids.She has never lost her patience with Mason and he has challenged her at times. HM is somewhat concerned that she lets Mason get away with too much, he has broken a few rather expensive items,while in her care. I send her a link to "" How to talk, so your kids will listen"" Laura is a bit frustrated that Jennifer is still afraid to drive far,including to school. She did however drive to Washington Crossing over the weekends to a friends,which is good. I helped Laura to understand that Jennifer may be apprehensive to drive in the dark on country roads without a GPS. I lent them mine so she could go take her placement test this evening at BCCC. Laura's other concern is that Jennifer does not attempt to prepare meals even for herself, unless Laura cooks or ask her to. AP has only cooked two meals in two months. I suggested she have her in the kitchen watching as she prepares meals, letting her know that she needs to learn how to prepare the children's as well,  meals moving forward.I also suggested she ask AP to prepare a dish from her country once a week, to help AP feel more comfortable in the kitchen all together.  HM said that AP is good with the broom ,yet has not vacuumed the kids rooms yet.I remined her to have a daily talk, as well as a 20 min talk each week, to praise her for the jobs done well and to offer direction for the jobs where improvement is needed."
3564706,Everything is going really well. Tyna was back a week ago and everything is back on schedule.
3564697,"Things are going well. AP has been on vacation (last week) and HF picked AP up from the airport last night. HF is busy with travel this month, but things are well."
3564693,Everything is going well.

3564678,"Things are going really well, HF had finally hit a stride with having an AP and are really glad they stayed with the program and worked everything out. Now they can't imagine life without AP. HF mentioned that AP has been working on potty training with their son and it's been a success, they are now able to apply to pre-school."
3564676,All is going weel. HF and AP are still in Florida and scheduled to come home on the first.
3564672,"Good, things have been hectic with the HF since they are applying to kindergartens for their daughter."
3564667,I spoke with Debra and she said Yudy is great.  She does not go out a lot during the week but she has friends she visits on the weekend.  She is great wth the kids. They have not talked about extending yet.
3564665,I spoke with HM. All is going wonderfully with Laura. She is a delight and a great addition to the family. HM had questions about new DS form that came from Scott at Corp. Laura left her's at home. Mom sent to her here and I sent it to APC. Scott just sent one from APC and told us to discard the one that had signatures from Columbia. It is fine that it has just APC sigs. in it.
3564664,"AP is a great babysitter and wonderful with HC, but has been showing up late for work often and has been found smoking in house.  HM has tried to explain to AP that these issues are not acceptable but AP does not seem to take HM seriously.  AD and HM discussed ways to discuss issues with AP. AD will discuss smoking with AP and follow up with HM."
3564661,"All is well, HF has found a new AP starting mid-March. HF loves their current AP and had her help with the new AP search."
3564631,everything is going well.  AP leaving May 3 and new AP arriving April 21.  Was confused with all the change at APC and wondered if that would affect arrival of AP. AD assured HM that AP's arrival would not be affected. AD and HM talked about previous APs and program.  HM has had very good experiences. There will be overlap with APs which she has done in the past.
3564622,Jeff said that everything is going well with Helena but they are sad to see her go in a few weeks.   They are excited to welcome Lizeth.  Apologized for not being able to connect sooner.
3564611,Everything is good - AP is wonderful with babies - but HF was disappointed AP has already decided not to extend - her family needs her in Korea - and HF feels they do so much to make AP happy they feel next time around they will find someone who wants to make HF happy!  They especially would like a driver next time - but feel this AP was the right one for the time
3564609,Good. Everything is good.
3564606,everything's great - she's good with the kids and seems happy - she's getting used to our routine and really seems to be trying - we worry a little because we hope she will get out more - AD is introducing her to other AP's - she will attend the monthly meeting
3564603,Everything is great!  Irene is getting acclimated but the kids love her and she's great with them - Alex took her out this weekend to test her driving and she's better than he expected but needs a little practice - she's excited to come to the monthly meeting!
3564589,Nothing to report. She's doing well. Family will be taking a vacation in February so she will be getting additional paid time off in addition to her 10 days.
3564559,"OK, AD spoke w/hmom twice this month and advised her how to communicate her expectations to Julie. AP has slacked off a bit in her extension year. Julie is very social and Hmom needs her to interact more with the girls. AD gave suggestions and hmom said it really helped."
3564551,everything's fine over here! She's doing great.
3564547,"just great.  Lou is so sweet - she is reaching out to the new AP and telling her what she does with the girls during her day, and how she helps out.  She will have her ""oriented"" before she's even here.  HM had a little trip to the ER this weekend, but everything's fine now.  Baby is due in a month."
3564546,Marcie called me back. All is good with Ji-Sook. Very much enjoying their time with her!
3564536,Jennifer let me know all is going great with Madlen.  She is great and they really enjoy having her for a second nine months!
3564506,"Spoke with Anne.  Nothing new to add. Things are going fine with Marion. Issues with excitement levels.  Gotten used to it in some ways. Going to Tahoe at the end of the month.  Went to Santa Barbara a few weeks ago.  Wouldn't get in the water.  Needs to play with the kids. May be a European thing, according to Anne.  Cell phone issue gotten a little better. Didn't talk to her. Asked about our CPR training."
3564494,All is going well. The family really likes Gaetan.  No issues.
3564489,"HM says that things are fine here. Though Karin missed her family quite a lot over the holiday, she seemed to enjoy the trip to Mexico. She had quite a bit of time off while there and seemed to appreciate the warm weather. Overall, things improved after our discussion of a couple of months ago."
3564469,"Spoke to Hdad, he reports that Oriane is doing great with her childcare, they love her and so do their kids.  He had questions re: the ext. process.  I answered his questions and also gave him his ext. app. deadline.  Dad says Oriane has made alot of friends while here in the U.S. Hdad said she had a great time at our ice skating activity."
3564467,After several attempts I spoke with Rekha and she said they are in selections and it is hard but she loves the videos.  THey are really helpful.  NO complaints they are really going to miss Gladys.
3564461,"Hmom reports that all is well with Jenny, that she continues to do a very good for them with her childcare. Hmom says they are discussing extending with one another but have time to decide.  I explained to Hmom that AP needs to have completed her Ed. Req. to extend. Hmom says Jenny is surviving our cold weather by doing more indoor things with the kids. Mom reports that Jenny is active in her church."
3564456,Spoke with Rachel. Said they are six months in.  Honeymoon is over. The family grapples with continuing in the program. Wanted to understand what the policies are for rematch/refund.
3564453,"Lara is a little frustrated, Lethy went back and forth in her decision to extend so they are going to go with an OS match. they hope to have someone for 2 years"
3564451,"Good, she has been great and pitching in as a family member already!"
3564444,Spoke briefly to ED. He was in a meeting. Everything is going well
3564441,Elda is doing a great job. The hF couldn't be happier
3564404,"AD spoke with HM, things are great as usual. HM says she has been meaning to get back into FR but has been busy and distracted, She will update soon and will look for mid April arrival."
3564395,"they are perfectly happy with Pavlina. she has planned quite a trip to go see her sister in Indonesia! Her sister is doing a travel company there so she will spend a week there.she is really part of the family, eats with them and does some cooking. went to the outlet malls with HM recently"
3564394,"Well.  I couldn't get Mary after 3 attempts so I called Jim.  He said things with Bettina are good and had questions about taxes and the next AP. I told him IC AP's should be coming up next month so I would keep my eye open and hopefully we will have some to discuss next month.  I emailed him the tax page and discussed it briefly, explaining that I am not licensed in that area."
3564391,"Joyce apologized for not calling me back last week.   She reported that things are going great with Hyeyeon. She is terrific, taking classes and doing well."
3564387,Things are going well.  HM had just landed in San Francisco.  AP leaves this week to travel home.  She will be back Feb 11th.  HM discussed that they would like to extend for 6 months.  We discussed the steps she will need to take to get that started.
3564385,Spoke with Amy.  First hiccup they've had with Sarah happened after her boyfriend came for a few weeks.  Sarah was homesick afterwards and thought about going home.  Has decided to stay.  Parents are coming in April.  Amy Asked about Sarah possibly going home a few weeks early for her boyfriends graduation and I told her her options.
3564381,Fine.  We had a long conversation about Natascha and how different she is from Cecilia.  Natascha maturity level is much lower.  She has to be reminded to help out at home as a member of the family.  Brian will be away at school for 7 weeks starting early March so Jen is a little worried about it.  She will need the ap to step up.  We talked about ways to talk with Natascha about it.  HM is well aware of the differences au pairs can have and is very patient.  She is a little concerned about March & April though.  The family is moving to N. Carolina end of June.  When she has an address she will give it to me.  Natascha will go with them and spend her last month there before going back home.
3564379,Things are going well.  HM discussed that she would like AP to help a bit more with family tasks such as clean up or set up for dinner.  She said it wasn't a big deal but she's noticed it hasn't happened.  I encouraged the HM to speak with her directly.  AP might feel the best way to help is with the kids.  If HM would rather have help with clean up then the AP should be told so she knows how to be most useful.
3564370,HM called to tell me that things are not going great.  AP is still having a rough time with the twins.  They have never really bonded and right now it seems like they do not enjoy spending time with the AP.  HM thinks the AP does not have a happy disposition with them which does not help the situation.  The youngest boy loves the AP so it makes it difficult because as much as he loves her the other two kids do not seem to like being with her.  We discussed different approaches AP could take with the twins.  I did suggest that the HM and HD sit down and directly address the issues.  HM mentioned that the AP is out late a lot and HM thinks part of the issue may be that the AP is not well rested and then her patience runs short with the twins.  I offered to speak with the AP or come and discuss issues at the house with everyone.  HM said her and HD will sit and discuss with her first and then perhaps follow up again.
3564362,"going very well, they never seem to have drama, always pretty even keel. Nicole is doing fine and keeps busy with her own activities as well. she went to HA with the HF and they all had a good time. they let her take a couple days on her own to do some activities as well."
3564353,"Kate is doing great. She is very mature and responsible. She broke up with her boyfriend and is spending much more time with at home, but she isn't intrusive. Kids love her"
3564324,Things are going well - we talked about Belinda extending and the class that she might want to take to get the last two credits.  They are very happy with her and she has some nice friends.
3564316,"Everything is going very well. HF bought AP tickets for our next two events (basketball game and ""Mamma Mia""). They enjoy having her as a member of their family and look forward to her extending for another year."
3564299,I had a hard time connecting with HM. Left several messages over the last few days. HM finally got back to me; she says that AP is doing well. She's joined a local gym and is enjoying herself. AP will take her driver's test next week.
3564291,"Things are going OK. HM says that AP wants more autonomy with the children, however she tends to not be very engaging with them at times. They've talked things over and she thinks it will work out."
3564290,Franzie is doing a great job and the HF is still hoping she will extend. She was in a car accident but it wasn't her fault she is okay
3564286,AD spoke to HD. Everything is going well.  HD stated AP has blended right in and connecting with HC. Previous AP never really connected with HC.  HD stated transition from previous AP to current AP was very smooth and she is the best placement they've ever had!
3564283,HD got back to AD.  He said they have no issues or complaints with Pak.  HM also called back AD.  She said if they get another AP or not will depend on their finances and if she sells another house or not.
3564259,AP is still here and is showing new AP around - HM wants to deduct $250 from AP stipend for damage done to car in accident - AP got driver's information but not insurance information so now HF's insurance is covering it but premium will go up - AD will call AP and find out what is happening with car
3564249,AP is very dependable and has made strong bonds with Elias.
3564248,AP is very dependable and has made strong bonds with Elias.
3564246,Everything is going very good. Bernardo is doing a great job. He will have 2 weeks off in April and the HF is talking to him about staying on for his 13th months to get them to July when the kids go to camp
3564241,Heather let me know all is going well with Ambre. Ambre had a good time at our meeting the other night.
3564239,"All is fine with Sandra.  Nice to have her back. There is a lot of familiarity. Has made some new friends in the area, including Sarka."
3564231,"AD spoke with HM.  They just returned from Disneyworld last week, and had a marvelous time.  She said AP continues to do well."

3564202,Things are going well - Magdalena was off to NY this weekend and they are planning their trip to the Island the week after and really looking forward to it.
3564201,"Fine.  She missed the boat (literally) at the AP event  and since AP didn't pay her phone bill, she couldn't get my texts and calls."
3564196,Sarah will let me know when she wants me to come for the APO -things are going well and they are getting to know each other.
3564194,Matt says that things are going very well and Candy is a great au pair.  She is planning her vacation for a week and is looking forward to that.

We worry a bit about her social life and feel that the other APs in BH are more social and maybe she has a bit of a hard time fitting in - AD had emailed all the Polish APs suggesting they get together and offered to have more APs reach out - HM appreciates -

3563987,"Julieta is doing great. She is dating, taking classes, etc. HM called to see if APC offers Educare. AP would like more school.

Mom also says that her friend Lindsey has applied and asked about the referral bonus?"

THey have been making bracelets for the last few weeks now. Tasja broke up with her boyfriend too."
3563894,"Good. They like AP and think she likes them too. Blake is a bit clingy to parents, which is hard for everyone. Then on the weekend Blake begs for her. AP is going to test for her driver's license. HM is not comfortable with her driving yet. AP would like to take car to classes in Roswell. She does not want AP to drive HC, and is worried that she might have an accident. AD went over the $250 AP would pay to HF for an accident, and discussed possibly lowering the deductible. AP has been having trouble making friends.She has one good friend in Decatur, AP Celine, but has not connected with lots of others. HF is going to Spain in June and July. AD let HM know that AP can go for 30 days."
3563872,"Things are going well and HM has no major concerns with the AP.  HM has been working non-stop with multiple projects going on in tandem, so she has extremely busy.  HM said that AP seems to be enjoying her art classes.  AD asked about her plans after May when the AP's contract ends.  She will speak with the AP and we'll discuss our options after that."

AP is considering and will let the HM know.  AP's father flies in this Fri for a visit and HM expects them to discuss this option when he's here."

3563830,"AD and HM Jayme had lengthy conversation.  She is very pleased with AP's childcare skills, and AP remains one of her favorite two APs.  Match is 100% compliant.  However, HM is concerned because of AP's sudden need to go home for a visit, and they have concerns as to whether she will return back to MD after a week.  They are taking a risk, they worry, in allowing AP a week to go home, and because she has been having boyfriend problems back home, they worry that the chance that AP will be convinced not to return to US is great.  HM would like to have access to list of available APs (not to contact or interview, but just to have instant access if they hear ""at 11pm on a Friday night"" that AP will not return, they can start looking right away.  AD agreed to look into this for HM, but suggested that it may not be possible."
3563818,"HM AP is one of the 2 best AP's she had. Not so very self centered and is taking good care of her children. They had a few hick ups when she went back to work, AP failed to pick up HC from pre school on time, but they have figured it out and all is smooth now."
3563814,Hmom reports that all is great with AP Julien.  Mom says her boys adore Julien and love it when he has dinner with them.

Mom reports that Julien is great at keeping the boys active.  She said Julien had fun at our activity.
3563803,"HF is doing well.  HM reported that everything's fine and she has no concerns.  AD asked what her plans are for the program when the AP's extension expires in May.  She's not 100% sure, but will most likely be leaving the program since the youngest will be in school.  AD and HM will discuss more next month."
3563783,HM is in car just leaving grocery store. HF's move is happening in the next couple of weeks. Move date is week of Feb. 16. Probably Thursday or Fri. AD let her know that she would put everything in the system and get her and AP in touch with new AD. AD wished her well with move

3563717,Ana is doing very well.  She has a very positive attitude about her experience and making the most of it.  The morning routine has been going much smoother.  Even her HP's are on board and have allowed for an Ipad reward of 15 minutes on the weekend if the girls reach their goal. AP was at the meeting.

3563713,"AD spoke with HM, she has been busy at work and ap and daughter will travel with her to Florida in two weeks for a vacation. HM says that ap is doing well, HM says she is convinced that the AP's are teenagers and if you lower your expectations, things will be better. HM said for example, if the trash is over flowing, or something is spilled on the counter, if you ask, they will do it, but doing it on their own is unheard of."
3563694,"Things are good. AP does a great job with the boys. He is pretty quiet about his personal life and  then AP stuff, but HM says he seems happy and she is happy with his AP skills."
3563693,All good. Had productive weekend and even went to social security office. Aroa seems nice.
3563684,Carolina is great in all but one aspect. Driving. took her to LA Zoo car park to practice and her driving is not good at all. Couldn't do basic things and is not ready or safe for the. Road. Hf is very concerned as need a driver Thant can hit the ground running. Looked into intensive driving lessons but wants ap to pay for them and APC to credit her for the time she is without a usable Au pair.  I looked into this request but was confirmed that APC does not provide a credit which I let HM know.

It was great and they loved it.
3563625,"Spoke with Doug and he said all is just fine with Karen.  She is apparently working on staying and is possibly getting married.  Doug informed me that he was not thrilled with the guy but that Karen continued to do a good job caring for his kids.  He also knows that she is doing what is by the book to try and stay here, but if her ducks are not in a row before she goes that she has booked her flight home.  He said that he has been very pleased with AuPairCare for the past 3 years but they due to financial circumstances cannot continue on with us after Karen.  They are signed on with another agency and he said he couldn't remember which one.  Not sure I believe him...thinking it may be they can't afford any agency right now, so I will keep checking back to see if somehow they can swing staying with us in March."
3563615,So far so good. Gisele is a nice girl.  We will do AO next week.
3563602,Licia just got back from her Bahamas cruise and they are happy she was able to have some nice downtime.  She thinks she is starting her next class soon.  No complaints and they are thrilled with the idea that she may extend!

3563580,Things are good.  HF is looking into extending with AP.
3563579,"AD spoke with HM who feels that things could be better. HM says that AP is like an older child sometimes. She feels like she has to micromanage her. HM says it is no reason to rematch or end the match, just that it is frustrating sometimes. HM really hopes that the next match is a strong one."
3563572,Heard from Diane and she let me know that Amy was in fact back safe and sound.  They are happy that she was able to get home and spend some quality time with her family over the holidays.
3563569,AP and HF had a really good first weekend and they communicate well. AD was supposed to visit for a/o on 1/28 but HC has the flu so we will postpone it till next week. AD is sending education info to AP.
3563566,AD spoke with HD twice since AP arrived. Everyone is settling in nicely. HD is reviewing things with her. HD took a chance at the SS office despite the suggestion to wait the two weeks. AP could not obtain so they will go back at a later time.
3563564,"HM feels that she and AP communicate openly, and that they are doing well.  She said AP is even teaching her things about kids!"
3563562,Things are going well.  HF is still interested in extending.  AD went over deadline of Feb 28.
3563560,"Margaret says things continue to go well. We discussed extending. She said she would like to however, Dani wants to return home. I told her to discuss with Dani her exact intentions whether it is to return home or if she would be open to extending."
3563543,HM says AP is adjusting well.  The kids really have taken to her.
3563537,HM said they love Johanna and they want her to stay longer. HM very happy that she met 2 new Brazilians in the area and is getting out more.  She likes her school.

3563535,HM said Ivan is very good at many things and he tries very very hard but sometimes he forgets and is a bit slower than HM would like but overall she said he is good. They are thinking about 2nd year and the timing. Told HM she can reapply for free and if they do decide to extend then they can fill out ext. papers.
3563533,AP continues to do a great job with the kids.  They all like her and she is a hard worker.
3563532,HM said Marne is doing great but cannot say the same about the AD.  She would only like to be called past noon and have her home number updated to main contact number. 6786733555
3563529,"LIgia's placement ended very quickly after she hit a parked car driving down a narrow snowy and icy street on her 5th day of being in MI. HF took her driving on Sat. as soon as she arrived and reported she was a good driver. they drove to the different locations for the kids. On Tuesday they asked her to take the girls to gymnastics class and her hand held GPS took her in a different direction that what her HM showed her. She was driving down a narrow street looking for the street sign to turn on when she hit the parked car.  HF asked for a rematch.  AP is helping HM out with childcare until they can figure out if they want a local Nanny, another AP or daycare.  Ligia did pay the $250 deductible and offered to pay the HM more but I told her that she was only responsible for $250. Since the accident Ligia has proven to her HM and AD that she is very mature, responsible and lovable person.  HM wishes she can keep her but reported to AD that she is a single mom and if there was another Accident she could lose custody of her kids.   Ligia has been providing excellent childcare in the home with the 2 girls as the HM finds them alternate rides to school and activities.  HM reported she found an IC match in NJ but HM needs to figure out the cost of the damage of the car and if they can offered to get it fixed or not as they did not have full insurance on the car."
3563524,Things are going well.  HM was glad to see AP attend meeting to meet other girls.
3563519,HM says things are great.  They love AP!  AP also has her license and is able to drive Michael's truck.
3563517,HM says AP is doing well.  AP's boyfriend is still in Atlanta (6mo tourist visa).   AD asked HM about AP's education and said she had already finished at Emory.
3563512,Well.  Kristy has some concerns about Anien who came to them last night to say that she may not want to extend with them after all.  She told her HF that she has not made many good friends here and may want to start over somewhere else.  I told Kristy I'd ask her Anien to have coffee with me and I'd let her know how it goes.  Anien has until 1 April to decide.  Luisa is doing very well.  She's had some driving lessons but they are not going to let her drive while there's snow on the ground.  She's not ready.  Anien is helping her get out by taking her here and there.
3563504,HF has been busy. No concerns or questions.
3563501,Good according to HD.  He commented on how much they enjoy the flexibility of an AP vs. a nanny.  AP does great with the baby which was their main concern
3563496,"HM got back to AD.  AP continues to do well.  Mary is planning her summer vacation for June, and they are also looking at putting the kids in camps during this time.  AP also celebrated her birthday this month."

3563484,very good. Is happy with HF and made friends with other area AP's.
3563477,HM and AD spoke mostly about AP's education. AP seems to be under the impression that she is due a full $500 from HF and HF will be covering all education expenses whether they are accredited or not. AD explained in detail what HF 's responsibility is in this area and this has been explained several times to the AP. HM will work this out and reiterate to AP. Otherwise everything else is ok.
3563474,Very well no problems or concerns. HF got a car for the AP and it has made everyone very happy. AP is able to take the baby out to do more things which has improved the experience for everyone.
3563472,Very well. No problems or concerns at this time. Both HF and AP are happy with the match.
3563463,I spoke to Hayley and she said they were doing fine.  I told her Therese had let me know about the car accident and she was really upset.  Hayley said they took care of it and everything is fine now.  She said Therese will pay them the $250 and all is well.  She said their Czech girl is coming in March and they are looking forward to that.  She said Therese is in Miami on her vacation right now.  Hayley said the best time to call her would be around 3-3:30 at home except on Wednesdays.  I told her I would try her then.
3563449,"Things are going well, time is going by so fast."
3563448,Things are going well just waiting for the Extension to be approved
3563447,"Thing are going well, Ap was a big help last month afte HM had minor surgery"
3563446,Things are going well no news on the move yer
3563444,"Well, things are going smoothly a few bumps in the road but HM was in a hurry to get back to work"
3563437,"Things are going well, Its been busy at home with many snow day"
3563430,Deb brought  Karin to our meeting so she could meet everyone and have fun! She is adjusting well and Deb is  improving on her spanish too!
3563420,"AD spoke to HM , he said Amy is very nice young lady and things are going well. She's adjusting to the children they didn't have a change to introduce her neighborhood and close by yet b/c of weather condition.  APO was rescheduled for Today January 22 at 5:30."
3563384,
3563381,Everything is well. Hm said Maria turned out to be a very good driver after some lessons. Hm said she did not know if Maria would extend for another year but she will ask her about her plans next week.
3563377,Franciele is doing a great job. HM is disappointed that they will have her for only 8 months. They would like to keep her longer. HM was also upset because their former AP Isabel texted Franciele and asked how she was. HM asked me to contact Isabel and tell her not to reach out to any of them ever again. I took care of that.
3563373,"HF loves Julia, they think she is great. She does a good job"
3563370,"Everything is well so far. Annabelle was super prepared for the program. She had already gotten social security card, bank account and scheduled an appointment to get the drivers license. She is happy to be here. The kids love her and the parents are happy. We had an easy APO"
3563368,Bianca is doing better. They got so scared after they received her call after the accident but everything is better now. the HP gave Bianca 4 days off to recover and they helped her with everything. They are thankful for APC support and glad that Bianca is better and did not break any bones.
3563364,Planning to extend with Lenah- Hooray!
3563357,"Mandy has had a hard time- her Grandfather died this month, and her father died a few months ago- 2 deaths is very hard to take.  She is holding up OK but she is sad.  (AD encouraging APs to reach out to her)"
3563355,"no problems, AP is doing a great job, couldn't ask for more."
3563354,"AP is fabulous!  HF is really enjoying having her.  She does a great job with the kids, and offers to help and joins in with family activities.  HD is hoping that AP will extend with them."
3563352,"HM didn't have time to talk right now, but asked if AD would come over to the home to talk about a few issues next week.  HM will get back with AD about scheduling a specific time."
3563351,"AP is very sweet and girls like her, but they are having minor issues.  The AP doesn't eat with the family because she likes to go to the gym when she first gets off work.  But then later in the evening, she will come fix dinner, but doesn't necessarily clean up or put foods away.  HM feels like she has had to talk to AP about so many issues lately.  AD offered to come speak with AP, but HM said she wants to continue trying first.  Also AP is oversleeping, and not being on time taking girls to school or picking them up.  AD made suggestions, and offered to come over again, but HM said not yet.  The family really likes AP.  Her English has improved a lot and she is very sweet."
3563349,Well- Kat was driving during the call.  AD mentioned Celine traveling to Cuba is not a good idea this year while a guest in the US.
3563347,"AP is doing a wonderful job with the children.  AP really connects with the kids, and they just love her.  AP is enjoying other APs and gets out and does things.  No problems at all."
3563346,HM just loves AP - wants her to stay forever!
3563345,"good, AP is doing a better job, and communicating with HM better.  She is working on being the adult/boss with the kids rather than their friend."
3563343,Very well- Melissa is wonderful.  AD saw Lea at the mall.  Melissa is taking the same class as Nicole.
3563342,"things are really going well.  HM has figured out the last AP did not train the new AP as well as expected, so HM has taken several days to work with AP and train her, herself.  Now it's going well.  HM talked to former AP and she said that new AP acted like she already knew everything, so it was hard to train her.  AP is cooking good meals for the girls, and really getting along with them.  Things are running smoothly."
3563341,HM was glad to hear Miku is talking with the au pair from Italy. She will also start with the classes. Miku is providing a good hildcare for their family
3563336,"HM said AP is great with the kids, helpful with the family. The AP and HF have a good working relationship. AP tries to spend time with the HF even though she has her boyfriend and spends a lot of time with him as well."
3563334,"AP enjoyed the holidays with the HF and enjoyed Canada. She is interested in extending and would like to stay in the area if possible. HM said they won’t extend because Evan is going to daycare and that was always their plan. The kids are currently  sharing a room and there is a significant age difference between them. She said Mariana can be very specific about what she wants and picky. HM said it’s fine and she’s tried to help out and be flexible, but she still can be really interested in her own things. A few days after we spoke, HM sent an email stating they had spoken to AP about not extending and AP took the info well. She also said AP has been doing great with the kids and they would gladly write a recommendation."
3563330,"HF is very confident in the AP and the HD told the AP she really wants AP to feel comfortable joining the HF in activities. HM commented on the AP ‘s reserved personality, but still feels very confident they will work together nicely. Also, AP talked more and responded more at this A/O and seems more comfortable with the HF, is using english more out of necessity with the kids, and seems more comfortable talking the AD too. (spent 3 days with AD while in rematch)"
3563327,HF feels like AP is like a daughter to them. They have been pleasantly surprised by her positive attitude and great relationship with the kids. She has spent a lot of time with the family and also has a good group of friends. AP enjoys the HF a lot and has no concerns.
3563325,AP turned in her return flight and is planning to go home.  HF and I discussed their AP search and they matched with a new AP arrival. The HC just celebrated their birthday last week on the 19th. AD saw the HF and AP on Monday for their party.
3563323,"AD sees AP frequently with HC in the neighborhood. AP said she is doing well  and she completed the project that the academy director requested. AP is very quiet and unexpressive. She seems to enjoy the kids in a very sweet and genuine way. She complained about her ear hurting and I encouraged her to go see a doctor. HM had quite a few complaints about the AP and was concerned that the AP isn’t out going and doesn’t plan ahead. Sometimes HM speaks to her in Spanish. She said the AP doesn’t try to joke around with the boys or engage with them. HM also said AP can drive in the area, but not far from the home and she can’t drive the kids at all."
3563319,Muni is doing great. HF said they loved Pierre but Muni is doing much better job as an au pair. Household is running smoother and Freya is well taken care of. HF loves her
3563317,"HM said AP has done well with the kids. She has a warm relationship with Anisha and get along with Suman as well even though he’s older and does his own thing. She is mainly a driver for his activities. HM said Anisha is at a difficult age where she can be moody and sometimes the AP doesn’t understand the HC’s comments or is she’s sarcastic or joking. HM tries to explain to her, but she said it’s ok because Anisha needs to learn too how to communicate with people and it’s a tough age. She thinks the AP’s english classes will help her as long as it isn’t too much. AP has had her sister visiting and was glad to see her. She has a good relationship with the HF and HC."
3563312,AP is very easy going and positive. HM said AP is great with both the kids. AP enjoys spending time with the kids and enjoyed spending the holidays with the HF. AP chose a class and will complete her education this quarter. No concerns from AP or HF.
3563309,"AP is doing fine with the kids and the HF. She has had a lot of questions about extending and her visa. She didn’t go to get her license because she was told by someone else she didn’t need it. I told her she should have the WA state drivers license and would have to have it before an extension.  AP is very unlikely to extend. HM said the AP doesn't always get along with oldest, but they've managed to work together. AP is better at getting things done around the home and the AP also has friends over to spend holidays with the HF."
3563307,AP gets along well with Aliyah. The HF was concerned about her getting out and making friends and AP is not a driver. AP is spending more time with groups of APs in the area going out or going to the gym. AP feels comfortable talking to the HF if she has any concerns.
3563304,"HF said Andrea is very different from Nini who was a lot more out going and had a different sense of humor. AP currently isn’t out as much , but the adjustment hasn’t been as hard this time. AP does spend time with friends and goes out, but she is more serious than the previous AP.  She is very responsible. She spends time with a few other APs she arrived with. HF said the AP has a good relationship with the kids so far."
3563300,Franci  was sad to say goodbye to her AP friend. Otherwise things are going well. She has a good relationship with the HF and they have appreciated her approach with the kids.

3563297,AP is great with the kids and HM has been very pleased that she takes her role seriously . AP cut her hand on the 1st of January and HM thought she might need to go to urgent care. AP showed me her hand a few weeks later and it was much better. She didn’t need to see a doctor for it.
3563294,"AP has done well. She is quiet, but she is making friends. She has a good relationship with the HF and enjoys the HC. She will not be at the activity in Feb because she will be at the HC’s birthday party. HF has no complaints. In some ways Marisela has been easier to acclimate than Jenny. She is more out going and her driving has been a bit better. AP also asked several questions about the Canadian visa and I sent her the info. She will go with the HF to Canada in a few months, but there isn’t a specific date yet."
3563290,Spoke with Jenn. She said that things are ok with Bia. Her mom was here for the holidays The kids are doing well.

HM said she’s done well with the kids even though she’s quiet. HM and I discussed finding a 6 month ext, ICAP, or renewing in the program. She renewed her application after our discussion.  HF will be taking their family to Ecuador for most of March and won’t need an AP or other childcare until April."
3563273,"Spoke with Brielle. She said that Michaela has asked for her boyfriend to stay over and to visit during the week.

3563243,"it feels like we're beginning to repeat our last au pair experience.  AP has been gone all weekend, still not home.  She stays in her room or goes out with friends.  We are inviting her to come join us for dinner, but we always have to ask her to join us.  HM asked if they can talk to another HF that has been successful incorporating the AP into the family.  AD has messaged a couple of families and will pass along those phone numbers to the HM."

3563131,"AD and HM had a talk Friday night, so hopefully this week will be better and they will have a fresh start.  AP has had NM visiting, and then the boyfriend visited for 2 weeks….so the past 2 months, AP has not focused on her job, and not been a good help.  In addition AP has been demanding and moody.  Hopefully they are back on track now.  HM really needs AP to help more.  AD suggested that AP prepare all the meals for the boys, especially since HM is dieting and can't eat what they eat.  HM said this would be a huge help and she will talk to the AP about this.  AP basically works 3-4 hours Mon-Fri."
3563129,Hm talked at length about their placement. HM feels that AP need to be briefed better how to do their job.HM admits that she is extremely busy but by AP not communicating with her doesn't help. HM thinks that AP wants to be out of the way but that's just not really helpful
3563128,"Spoke with Cynthia. She said that she was upset with Bruna upon their return from vacation in Mexico. She texted Bruna to have dinner ready for Athena. When they returned home, Bruna was not there. Cynthia expected that after a week away she would want to see all of them. They had words, and she said that Bruna talked back to her. She said that thinks are still tense. Suggested talking with Bruna about her feelings."
3563125,"very well, she is a  real sweetie"
3563124,It is going just great.  Laura passed her drivers test last week so she is happy.    She is taking ESL and has made friends so she goes out with them often.  She is doing a very good job with the kids.  She has such a pleasant manner  IT will still be better as her English improves.  Anne likes her a lot.
3563117,They are doing well.  Martin is settling in well with the family.  She has been very busy all this month.   it has taken Martin a bit longer to learn everything because he received training from the previous au pair who did not do a good job.  She is really glad she decided to have a male au pair for her son.  They do get along really well.
3563114,"Everything is great.  They really like Vi and she is doing a great job with Austin.  I told her that I had met with Vi to talk about her being so homesick and how we can all help.  Sherry knew about it too.  Vi has already talked to her Mom about not connecting every day.  There is a boyfriend too so that is another issue.  Her Mom may come for a visit.  We all are going to encourage her to keep busy, make friends, and enjoy her time here.  They have just added Vi to their YMCA account.so she can get involved there too.  Her class starts this coming week too.  We will keep in touch."
3563109,"HM says all is well, their daughter just had a birthday party and they have lots of people over. All is well from their end."
3563106,"Things with Sterlaine are going well, she is adjusting to linving in the suburbs with the HF.  HM said her and her partner are starting to talk about if they want to extend with Sterlaine or they may do a different form of childcare other than APC.   Explained the benefits to having an AP over a nanny or daycare.   HM says they are happy with APC but might want her daughter to get more social interaction as she gets over.  Pointed out she can sign her up for classes, etc."
3563099,Great.  It is working out okay.  She feels very good about that.  Bianca is very social and has found the class she wants to take.   Bianca is planning to go to Seattle in March to visit a friend  - around the 17th.
3563092,"HM says they are a good team by now. She can leave the house and know the AP is in charge and things are going well. Only sometimes HM comes across an incident that AP put plastic in the microwave, HM know she is anal about certain things.She has explained to AP about health dangers and thinks AP understands, those are just cultural differences that AP had to adjust to and learn."
3563091,Everything is fine.  No problems at all.  Mediha is  doing well with the boys. She has may friends and goes out with them often.  She is bust with her class too.
3563089,Everything is great!  She s wondering if Jeanette is allowed to go out of the country.  They want to take her with them to Denmark this summer.  I explained about checking the end date on her visa. to see if she needs to renew it while she is there.
3563088,"Spoke with HD. All is good. AP seems to be adjusting well, getting along with old AP and getting to know the area."
3563082,Good
3563067,Talked to HF who stated that things have been good and that they are adjusting well. They also told me that the kids and Aude  are getting along really well. They are going to be out of town for the week during February.
3563022,well
3563017,well
3563014,"very well.  AP's HP came to visit and that was good timing because AP was so homesick.  Now that they've left, AP seems to be doing much better, we don't think she's homesick and she has a good attitude."
3563012,Good. New Placement
3563004,Spoke with Sarah. Things are going well with Maria. They are considering extending. Maria would like to stay another 6mos. Reviewed the extenson process.

3562945,Everything is good. Danila is a very sweet girl. Every adult that mets her lives her and She does very well with Christopher. There is no connection between Danila and the two teenage girls. HM is upset with the way her daughters have treated Danila. The girls refer to her as dumb at times because her Her English is not the best. HM is working with her daughters on being nicer.  HM also feels bad that Danila's only friend AP Glenda just left. She wants Danila to have some friends. She is going to suggest that Danila take an English course to meet friends.
3562943,AD spoke with HM Sue who is happy to have matched. HF will have a month gap between AP's and have family assist. The boys are doing well. HM was a bit upset at Becky's messy room having dishes piled up when she should be more conscious. HM spoke to her on this.
3562937,"AD spoke with HD John on 1/24. Things are good between JJ and Giss, however they are encountering some issues with vacation time off. HF states that AP made plans with friends to travel and HF indicated this is not the best timing for them. HF will have a sit down with AP to make a better plan moving forward."
3562936,HM Sue returned AD's call for monthly update. The family has been very busy with HD being away this weekend. HM will return to work this week part time temporarily. Sue has been working with ME JL to process the pre-match with Daryela. AP Isabelle is taking a TOEFL course and will have her mom come to visit in the coming weeks.
3562918,"Melissa finally called me back today.  We set up the orientation for Monday, Feb 3rd.  She said Szymon is a wonderful guy -they are very happy with him so far.  Anton is still in country.  He's traveling right now and leaves for good on Thursday, Feb 6th."
3562912,HF were disappointed they were not able to be reimbursed for the dental costs for ap. I emailed them information for the UConn medical center dental clinic and the UB dental clinic if there are further problems for Vivi. Both clinics offer emergency after hours.
3562886,Good.  Spoke with Jaime and she says that she is glad to be back.  She has 3 weeks of leave and plenty of time to relax and get Joana acclimated to her new environment.  We have set the APO for Thursday the 30th at 6pm.
3562878,"I spoke with HF dad and he said everything is great, they still love having Zoe here."
3562851,Leo is doing well. No concerns or questions at this time. Kids enjoy her company and things are great

3562847,"Placement is going well, the AP & children get along very well.  HF have begun early search for new AP at a much, much later date. AP has been thinking of rematching for 2nd year and be in another location."

3562841,"HF continues to be very, very happy with AP and her happy attitude. HM hugs and kisses AP daily."
3562840,"HF is comfortable with the AP and happy with the AP's relationship with the children. HD says things are fine and when anything comes up they/he tries to handle it themselves. HD knows they always compare to their 1st AP Andrea who they deem as ""perfect"" and they try not to do that. Note: best to call the house number after 4pm."
3562839,"AP Angelica will be greatly missed. HM has begun search for new AP via JL, the ME. Update-HF matched with AP Jenny Paola Rodriguez Laverde from Columbia."
3562838,"AP is great. HF have begun search for new SN AP with help from JL, ME."
3562837,"HF had previous AP visiting with HF, who had spent some time with Megumi.  The intention was to have her give advice to new AP but they did not spend too much time together.  HM says she can tell the AP is trying harder but does tend to slip on duties once in a while. In-laws had also visited and noticed that w/clear & concise instruction AP does much better, so HM writes better instructions daily. HM concerned AP goes into room often when caring for kids and leaves them unattended. AP has started  Sunday evening hours, 3-5 hrs.  This RHF has never had AP work on weekends but with AP Megumi it seems to help HM to observe the dynamics between kids and address some safety concerns."
3562836,Placement continues to go well with AP.  The boys are older so its mostly driving to school and doing homework.
3562833,Placement is going very well. HF very happy with AP.
3562808,fantastic
3562790,met with HF and Cindy for the A/O. Reviewed expectations and schedule.
3562785,Met with HF and Andrea for the A/O. Reviewed expectations and schedule. Andrea is doing very well and is very happy to be here.
3562779,Met with HF and Narm for the A/O. Reviewed expectations and schedule. Narm's English is very good and she is adjusting well. HM reports she is already bonding with the children.
3562777,Everything is going well with Rolene. AP is leaving soon and HD still doesn't know what he is going to do. HD may retire or may travel more and HM may stay with the kids more. HD will let me know. Told HD that they could always wait a few months and get an AP in time for the summer if they have not made their decision yet.
3562776,Placement is going well and HF is very happy with AP.  She is great with the kids and there haven't been any problems.
3562769,Things are very good.  They are pleased with Ana.  She is doing a really good job with the twins.
3562766,It is going pretty good.  That is good news.  She is still smoking - but not in the house or in the yard   She is doing a good job with the boys.  Mako has said she is interested in extending/  Yuki said that is good.
3562765,Great.  There are very happy with Diana.  She fits in with their family so well.  Diana had fun at our event last week.  The babies are due any day now.  Stephanie has been put on bed rest now.
3562757,Things are going very well.  Everything is fine.  She ws leaving the next day for travel to Europe for work.
3562740,HF is doing well with new arrival; they have been spending the weekends in the mountains at their second home but we were able to squeeze in APO.
3562729,"Very well, AP is a huge help with boys who are very loud and busy."
3562728,Fine - with the family.  She is a good au pair.  HM concerned about her social life - been involved with some boys from college and they and a group of our APs hang out excessively. Concerned AP was lying about NOT dating them.  Turns out the other AP is now dating one of the boys so it's less awkward now because the HF and the AP doesn't think that the boy is trying to date her.
3562722,"So far, ok.  Grace is not the best in the kitchen and does need to be showed several times.  She is bad with measuring (i.e 1/4 tsp pepper will be 1 tblspn worth!).  She is good with cafety, play and caring.  Not so good with lessons -- so far she has recycled Angela's ideas rather than creating some of her own.  AD suggested that the AP use a teacher's guide (HM says she has them).   HM will take Grace to the event on Sunday.  AD will drive her home."
3562721,"Very well.  They are really happy with how things are going with Kathryn.  Amy and Kathryn sat and had a good talk about some things that happened.  Their communication wasn't great so Amy wanted to change that.  As a result things are much, much better.  Kathryn seems happier too."
3562720,"Everything is ok.    Eve is still doing well with the kids.  It is a different dynamic when the girls are working together and appreciates when they separate.  Marc is aware that Eve will be going to Mexico in her 2nd year, without the VISA extension.  He is aware she may run into problems getting back or be denied reentry.  He consulted with an immigration atty and shared the info with Eve, however in speaking with her friends and other au pairs has opted to try to go anyway to visit her family.  Fany is doing well with the kids. However her heart isn't where the family would like it to be.  If she is putting the bay down to nap for example, and it's 1:59:59, she will give the baby and toy and leave (he then starts to scream a few minutes later, but it's no longer her job to quiet him).  Eve would take the extra 5-10 minutes to ensure he is asleep before tiptoeing out the door.  AD spoke with HD about Fany's reviews from the families she has interviewed.  He understood and defended her lack of ""personality"" stating that she is different that Eve and even though she may have a quiet look, she does find the humor in things and it shows when she speaks.  Even if she is happy, it doesn't appear so until she's SUPER happy.  He is aware she may end up gong home.  He is NOT going to ask her to extend because he prefers the dynamic of his AP without her twin sister being there.  There is no chance he will ""save"" her if she can't find a new family."
3562719,"Very well.  In fact, they have asked Cheryl to extend when the time comes.  She has not committed one way or the other yet.  They are thrilled with the way she handles all the children.  HD said that he and Stacy have a hard time managing them together.  He isn't sure how Cheryl does it and so well."
3562718,Alison said everything is wonderful.  She said Mayra got her temporary drivers license.
3562717,Well.  Meg said she had a sick child so she couldn't talk long.  Tania is doing a great job.  They are very happy with the program.
3562715,Very well.  Katrin did a great job last week managing with all the school snow days.  HM said they have great communication which helps a lot.  Her boyfriend is coming for a visit next month.  The HF could not give Katrin the time off she wanted because it is tax season and that means they are very busy.
3562713,"Good, nothing has changed."
3562709,Very well.  I got to speak with Karen because I called on the weekend and she happened to be home.  She said there were a few issues with Meike (HD always says she's awesome).  There were a few very minor issues early on but Meike is a great girl.  HM tends to be a bit of a perfectionist.  We talked about their overall experience with their au pairs and it has been very good.  She told me about the referral bonus they got.  I reminded her to have any families call me directly and she said she would make sure they do that.
3562705,great
3562701,Everything continues to be the same. HF was out of town over the holidays and AP stayed home and took some time off.
3562694,All is going well. AP will go to TCU CI and then to CollinCC for coursework. She will take ESL possible and then dance. Will take a driving course as she is not a very experienced driver.Her English is good and she is very sweet.
3562685,"Conducted AO. Everything is going well so far and former AP is there to help train her. She will start working on her own next Friday. We discussed getting SS number, and I helped her print out her I94 card and insurance card. She will work usually M-Th with split shifts Tue and Thurs, some weekend or evening depending on the week, but typically weekends off."
3562683,Everything is going very well. HM stated they are very sad to see AP leave. She doesn't think it has hit the kids yet that AP is leaving so soon.
3562664,everything is fine. Chatted for a few minutes to catch up. All is well. They are looking into another service for au pairs in town and wondered if we could verify and be a reference. I said I would be happy to read through their history and give them a reference.
3562662,Great
3562660,"HD Kosti returned AD's call and was brief and hurried, as usual.  He said that ""everything is great and we have no concerns or problems that need your attention.""  Confirmed that match is compliant."

3562519,"AP Laura is adjusting well and seems comforted that current AP Lara is training her. Right now HM Michelle said that she is having AP Lara do everything and have Laura simply shadow her. Laura did comment that last week was stressful with the arrival of the new baby boy named Leonardo, who arrived 2 weeks early. AP Laura commented that he is ""so small."" Laura did also say that her first week that the eldest son Elias was shy around her and would only respond to Lara but now he seems to be warming up to her.   I encouraged AP Laura to apply for her social security card so that she may get her IL driver's license. She already has received a bank card in the mail from Chase (HM set her up for direct deposit) so after she receives her ss card, she will have the necessary two pieces of residency.   AP Laura said that she is speaking almost all German to both the HM and to the children, per the HM's request (HM Michelle said that she grew up in Germany.) AP said that she speaks English only to the Dad in the household. Also, AP seems to be hanging out only with current AP Lara, so I encouraged her to introduce herself to the other APs, including non-German APs, in order to have her speak more English.   AP expressed interest in taking a photography class. I gave her the list of accredited schools in all the documents.   I reiterated the 10 hour daily/45 hour weekly maximums with a full weekend off a month to HM MIchelle.   Lastly, HM Michelle said that current AP Lara did not understand how to enroll in the new UnitedHealthCare insurance, so I reviewed that with both HM Michelle and AP Laura."

3561802,"Everything is going well.  HM stated AP is much better than last AP and she is great with HC.  There was a small communication problem this week.  5yo HC is interviewing for schools.  HF wanted AP to practice driving to interview. HD was in car with her and mentioned that the interview was the next day, but AP seemed surprised.  HD mentioned it again at dinner and AP got upset. HM tried to talk to her about it but she didn't want to talk about it.  HM spoke with AP about it the next day and AP stated it was not a big deal because they speak every night so she knows she wouldn't have missed the appointment.  HF stated that when they tell AP about things verbally she doesn't write them down. AD gave HM some ideas on how to improve communication.  AD mentioned putting calendar and house rules in writing in a binder to leave in the kitchen and ask AP to review it periodically.  While it is the APs responsibility to remember what she's told verbally, it's good for the HF to put it in writing.  HF has weekly meetings with AP so  AD suggested that they give AP a weekly calendar at that meeting and write in any changes that happen midweek.  AD also suggested that HF ask AP to bring notepad to weekly meetings so they know she is writing down changes to the schedule.  AD reinforced that although AP's English is very good, it's not her native language so putting these things in writing would be helpful for the HF. HM mentioned their house rules say to ask if AP doesn't understand so AD suggested they remind AP it says that and also mention that they can write it down or email it to her if that is helpful. HM stated that she loves having an AP over a nanny because of they have an AD as a resource.  HM will give AD an update in the coming weeks."
3561791,"AP just arrived, but so far all is well."
3561778,HM shared that she appreciates AD support and ck in monthly and that thankfully things are going beautifully as usual.  No concerns and they are awaiting for the ext to go thru with the DOS and they are thrilled about it.  No concerns to spk of.
3561774,"We had a mediation on Thursday January 23rd about an incident that involved Ivana apparently ""hitting"" Tommy.  Ivana clearly stated it was a guiding nudge to help Tommy get going in the right direction.  The boys have been more difficult this month with all the days off from school.  We discussed how to better work with the boys in difficult situations and hope that Bridget will be able to communicate with Ivana more each week."
3561772,HF +_AP are doing fine. H mom anxious leaving the AP in two week time to go back to work. AD made Hmom and AP feel better after APO.
3561769,I spoke to Joe and he said all is going well and they are looking forward to having their aupair come next month.  He said all is well with Signe.

3561756,Per HD everything is going terrific.  Roberta is wonderful and a complete part of their family.
3561743,HM shared she and the family are very happy.  All they want is the AP to stay for another year.  She has acclimated and there is nothing to share of concern.
3561721,"HD says things are going well, HF settled into the routine after Christmas and all seems to be going well. HM andAP have once a week meetings, where AP speaks up if she has concerns, so HD doesn't see a need for AD to come out."
3561712,"Great - AP mostly takes care of 4yo and HM takes care of baby - HM works at home - but AP has been great and HM is really hoping she will extend - she asked AP about timeframe so described the early match discount, etc.  HF new to the area so AD talked about local resources, mommy & me classes, etc."

She is still figuring out if they will host or not for next year, and wondered if there is an age limit for HC.  She said her girls witll be 14 and 15.  AD verified with Sarah Altman that 18 is the age limit for HC.  AD relayed this to HM, and let her know she is in great shape to host again."
3561708,Emily called me this morning. Pauline may have an ear infection. Asked me for the Stanford Express care contact information.

3561707,"HM says all is fine, AP has some friends coming from SF and she is hoping they will have safe travels. All is fine in their house nothing to report."
3561699,Spoke to host mom on second attempt things are going very well and we discussed the fact that they had renewed their application and had some questions about extension aupairs . I encouraged them to  consider an overseas ap who has experience living away from home so to keep their options open.
3561690,HM says all is well no problems to report.
3561678,good ap does well with the children - ap was away over the holidays and things seem to be going ok and they are getting back into schedule.

3561655,AP is wonderful  HF very pleased with AP

3561599,"Tings are going well, Ap is sick of the snow and cold weather like everyone in NJ."
3561578,Great.  Older daughter is going to activities during the week.  HM has her mom staying with her until April to help with the baby.  AP is wrapping up her year and it was a great year.  HM would like to see AP have a better sense of direction in her life.  HM is looking forward to arrival of new AP.
3561570,"HM says she is doing fine no problems at all. HF didn't remember that it was a DOS requirement to talk to AD every month, they were trying to be helpful and not take up AD's time."
3561562,They are happy with Fernanda and would be thrilled if she would extend.  She has become part of their family.  She is away now on a cruise and hope she is having a well deserved great time.

3561545,"she is wonderful, fits with the family very well.  We talked about AP needing more driving practice, she drove to AP meeting in January, and seemed to be very nervous.  In the family, she is doing a great job."
3561538,"HM shared that there are ups and downs, better these days.  Is wonderful with the kids but, doesnt take care of herself as she should.  AP is very lazy at tiimes and complains alot (very whinny and needy)  Room is always a mess and her bathroom is usually dirty so, the HM has to continually have to remind her what she has to do.  Feels that she puts these issues aside because she is assisting and supporting her son who is in need special TLC.  He is having a difficult time in school and the AP is helping him immensly.  HM wants to continue to trying to work it out and is not looking for a rematch at this time nor looking for the AD to intervene in anyway.  Hm asked about the time frame to choose another AP and AD discussed the process"
3561534,HD says all is fine no problems to report.
3561532,Doing great!  Hana is stressed out due to classes.  She tried to get into 3 of them to get them done before the summer but one was cancelled due to low enrollment.  She was going back over there today to see what was left to register for to get the 3rd class.
3561497,"HM says all is fine and that she knows she has to go into HF room, for her extension with AP Sofia."
3561496,AP just arrived but they HC already seem to take to her and are very excited. AD and HF did arrival meeting and went over HFs book with guidelines and rules.
3561495,So far so good but it's only been 24 hours.  All is confirmed for the APO on Tuesday night.  They are looking forward to showing Flavia around the area today.  All went fine with her pick up yesterday.
3561480,HM returned call and says all is good.  No problems.  They moved last month and things were a bit chaotic but she says AP has been a huge help with that process and transition.  No questions.
3561475,HM shared the AP is phenominal and is doing so well with the children that she can't think of one bad thing to say.  Shared the AP truly loves them and everyone around them can see her dedication and love of children and caring for them.  Shared she has been a rock to the family.  No concerns at all.
3561472,well
3561460,They are doing well.  Move date was moved to March 1 now because of the builder.  They are looking forward to more space.  Things continue to be great with Debora.
3561458,"Well.  AP going to LIU this weekend and still has to complete another class, probably BMCC DC course.  No vacations planned yet.  Keeping boys busy. Talked about getting back in selection in March for a June arrival."
3561442,HM shared that they are all so happy.  Shared that now that they are in their ext time they are care free for close to a full year and they can't be happier.

HM stated that even though many of her friends have completed their year and left she has made an effort in making more and more friends which they are relieved about. No concerns.
3561416,Very well. No problems or concerns. They have spoken about several smaller issues. HF is looking at extension APs mainly as their new AP. They will continue to look and may also interview a Thai AP they saw online.
3561415,"HM shared that they are all doing well.  A bit crazed because they are still in the midst of packing and getting themselves together for the fly & move to CA on Sunday.  HM feels things are progressing well and is looking forward to a hopeful smooth transition in CA.  HM shared she had not received contact from the new AD yet (Gael) and HM asked for her contact info so, she can reach out to her.  AD sent the email and phone contact to HM as requested.  No concerns at this time."
3561414,Hm told me that the placement is going well!
3561413,She just arrived last night.  We have the arrival orientation scheduled for Sunday.  I am looking forward to talking to them.  The host moms wants some guidance to help AP take some English classes.  Her English is not the best.
3561390,"hey are doing about the same, but better than last month.  Some things just aren't going to change...like it baffles Anne that Alejandra isn't aware that she is on her phone a lot or not talking to Juliana.  It is just a part of their generation, and she would probably do the same thing at home.  This is her home for now so she sees it less as a job.  Anne told her for the sake of her furture, but she wasn't upet about it at the time."
3561369,"Well.  He has no complaints  She is good with the girls and very nice and respectful.  He cannot imagine not having her here.  He wouldn't be able to make it. She is having fun too, they travel a lot and she will come.  She has lots of freinds but is also quiet."
3561357,"HM tld me that things are great. She is fantastic, very diligent driver and great with all of them. She failed the written driving test yesterday, so will have to take it again, but Hm is not concerned."
3561350,"Good, ap is leaving in May and family is not repeating."
3561341,Hm stated AP is doing great.  Got through together one of the boys sick and in hospital and AP was a big help.
3561332,VERY GOOD
3561317,OK
3561290,good
3561289,All is well
3561288,"She arrived fine and we are all having the orientation tomorrow. They went out to dinner and then she went to bed. HM was confused, because AP came with several other APs, but she was the only one that picked up her AP from the airport. AD said she did the right thing. She asked several more questions."
3561287,great as always
3561278,good
3561270,good
3561269,All is well
3561263,great  Does au pair receive weekly stipend yes  Any concerns with the 10 hr/day and 45 hr/week schedule?no  Any concerns with childcare and any non-childcare related duties?no  Any concerns with time-off/vacation scheduling?no  Is au pair scheduled or planning to take educational courses?yes spoke 2x to hf this month. hd called me about a tax question in which i wasnt' sure of answer so i emailed jennifer warner and told hd i would get back to him on it. i also emailed him some apc F &Q tax forms for his review. i also spoke to HM. everything is going great with ap she said. ap's mom from mexico stayed with them over christmas and they really enjoyed her compan
3561240,All is well
3561238,great
3561224,perfect
3561223,Joleyn said everything is good.  She said Isa gets along great with everyone and everyone has a good time.
3561219,HM told me that all is well
3561218,great
3561211,HM shared that they are all doing extremely well.  Shared how they have really begun to enjoy their new neighborhood and its been great with local AP's in building which offers great play date opportunities for Kelly and the babies.  HM is very happy.
3561206,SHE ARRIVES TOMORROW
3561196,good
3561193,"They welcomed Kressy and had a great dinner last night and loved how she asked the girls a lot of questions. At the end of the night, the AP was crying and when asked, she said she was really homesick and that she had had a bad experience with the other APs at AP Academy. they were mean to her and excluded her. So, HM thinks that colored her emotions, as she did not feel so welcome in her first week. Plus, she was extremely jet-lagged, so HM thinks that her exhaustion had something to do with her sadness and homesickness."
3561134,"HM says everything is fine. AP didn't end up going to the doctor with her ankle. HM is a doctor herself and monitored her, put a ankle brace on and so she recovered well"
3561128,Not well.  HD is very upset with how things are still going.  AD talked about rematch and explained after 6 months that the family will receive a credit.  AD has gone to the home in the past to talk with AP about the same issues that are currently existing.  AD advised family that if they are going to rematch they should do so prior to the 6 months.
3561127,Everything is going very well.  Everyone continues to be very pleased with the AP.  HF is very sad to think that in a few months they will have to start looking for a new AP.
3561126,"Match is not working well for HM.  It bothers HM that AP does not go out and do more. HM does not want to wait until September for a change, as APs arrival in beginning of school year was too disruptive.  Went over refund policy and will EM transition policy to HM so she understands.  Does not want to do anything before 6 month mark, and would be limited to a credit towards next AP."
3561116,Everything is going really well.
3561095,"Great, AP is wonderful with son and they have a great schedule working out and HF is happy with the program.yes"
3561087,"Excellent, HM cannot say enough about AP...things are ""perfect"" AD told HM that AP had asked about extension...HM was delighted"
3561081,"AP is good with kids, still not finding a group of friends she is comfortable with. AD spoke to HM at length about school and school options. AP will take her CT drivers test in MArch"
3561076,"Everything is going well. Josi mentioned some problems HF was having with Julian and problems Julian was having with HF but she said they had sat down and talked about the issues and things are much better now. Tami mentioned that they might be moving because of work purposes and she is not sure how the transition would be for the program. I assisted her with some of the questions, but it is just a possibility for now, so I asked her to keep me informed."
3561071,"Everything is going well. I have been in touch with AP and HF pretty often this month, since is the deadline for extension and Buse was still working on her education requirements. Buse concluded her classes this Wednesday but AP and HF were having a hard time with application format. I have been assisting them and we were able to send application today."
3561038,The AP just arrived and both parents indicate that things are good and comfortable at this time.
3561031,"Well.  HF just drove back from Orlando, as their flight home was cancelled due to the storm.  They stopped in DC for one night.  AP disappointed they didn't bring her.  They like AP, but HM finds AP a bit ""young,"" and at times, sarcastic, which kids don't always understand.  Suggested HM talk to AP about better ways to express herself.  AP signed up for course at Fairfield U.  Is good friends with Pamela."
3561028,"All is great with Tess, she is wonderful with the kids and they enjoy being with her.  The cold weather is an issue as the kids are stuck inside all the time."
3561026,Well.  I asked HD if he could give me insight as to why Cindy says she can't come to the monthly AP meetings if it is on a Sunday night.  He said her family is very busy and can only talk to her on Sunday night.
3561021,things are going very well Ap is just a wonderful person and always happy
3561019,All is going very well. Grandmother is there with AP now as HD is traveling on business.  She is great with the kids and no issues at all.
3561018,"everything is working out great.  AP is doing a good job.  She always smiles, and it's contagious!  The children adore her.  She is so energetic, upbeat, she is absolutely perfect."
3561011,Well.  House is going to be quiet with 2 boys starting college next year.  Caroline and Julia are coming to visit this summer.
3560996,Great.  AP was in Orlando this week. HM got sick right after she left and Hayden broke his wrist snowboarding.  So will miss rest of current hockey season.  HM will be taking care of 7 week old niece while her parents go to Mexico. HM thrilled AP is thinking about extending. AP already has CTDL. Sent EM re extension process. Taking AP with them to Florida where they are staying in house in April.  Considering taking AP with them to Puerto Rico in August.  Talked about AP considering whether she is going to need to renew visa for extension year.
3560993,I spoke to Kyle and she said they are doing well.  She thanked me for letting Sunni ride with me to the last aupair meeting.  She said they had a lot of fun and she liked the necklace she had made.  I told her about the next aupair meeting at the Tiger Swan Shooting range.  She said she will be excited to do that as Yolanda had fun at that one.  I let her know about he special we are running until the end of the month and she said she will try to let some of the folks know who she works with about it.
3560988,Spoke with Hd and everything is good. Hm traveling this week. Ap fits in extremely well with family
3560980,"Things are still OK, HM had a long talk with AP on 1/22. HM feels AP just does not like authority and AP wants to do his own thing. EXP HF was away for the holiday weekend and AP car broke down, AP text HM that AP was taking out the HD car and AP is not allowed to drive the HD car. HM gets upset about is the fact he finds nothing wrong with his actions.  Another example is AP has a credit card for gas , food shopping and expenses for the children.  Ap used the credit card for Xmas shopping and then went to the HM and told her he used the card to buy presents or the HF.  HM went over the importance of asking first for permission with anything that is different from the normal routine.  Hm wants o give him 2 more weeks and does not want AD to speak to him. AD will follow up in 2 weeks"
3560978,"great, AP has done such a great job.  Child is fluent in Thai, but English is delayed because parents don't get to spend a lot of time with him speaking English.  Looking for new AP but really want someone from Thailand."
3560970,things are going well. They are at the end of their time and have matched with a new aupair
3560969,"very well.  He is very engaged with the children, and pursing his studies.  He fits very well with the family."
3560964,Things are great. Patriciaa will be going to Costa Rica with her husband on Presidents week but Julia does not know if she will take vacation time then or not
3560961,"Kent has gone above and beyond and is so helpful.  He has a doctor appt today and asked AP to touch base to make sure that he has his insurance questions answered, so he won't get a big bill."
3560960,"Good, Ap is great, Ap does travel to VT with HF on most long weekends. AP is respectful and a family member. AP is taking her drivers test"
3560958,"AP is doing a good job, they have had no problems lately.  Her attitude is greatly improved and the kids absolutely love her."
3560957,Things are going great. Her mom will be coming for a visit and she has made many friends in the area. They took her snowboarding and treat her as part of the family. There was one problem when Bridget was sick and it was Lena's first day of school but they have addressed that. Spoke to Barbara and all is well
3560956,"AP is doing great, HM is sad they will lose her in a few months. HF is searching would like a german as they have german family members, need someone with work experience"
3560954,"great, no problems.  Everything is running smoothly."

3560931,I spoke to Craig and he said everything is going well.  He said they are all enjoying their time together.  He said she really enjoyed the aupair meeting last month and  I told him about the aupair meeting in February.  He said she has just started to take some college courses so that is going well too.
3560930,"Things are going well, Hm told AD that her last AP from SA was killed in a car crash back in SA. Everything is going well with AP"
3560929,I spoke to Lisa and she said everything is going well.  I told her missed Michele at the last aupair meeting and that the meeting was in Abereen close to her.  She said the meetings were a drive for her and I explained she can carpool with the aupairs that live 20 min from her to make it easier.  I told her I would also let Michele know that.  I told her when the next meeting is and she said she will try to make sure she is there.
3560906,"Great, HM reports that in weeks like this, snow days and cancellations it's a great thing to have an ap. they are extending for 6 months. All is well. No concerns"
3560905,HM returned my call. She says everything is fine and is hopeful for a good extension year.
3560898,All is well.  They are waiting to hear back on AP's extension approval.  No problems or questions.  HM was preparing for their youngest child's 1st b-day party that evening and was glad AP would be there to help celebrate.
3560897,All is well.  They are waiting to hear back on AP's extension approval.  No problems or questions.  HM was preparing for their youngest child's 1st b-day party that evening and was glad AP would be there to help celebrate.
3560896,All is well.  They are waiting to hear back on AP's extension approval.  No problems or questions.  HM was preparing for their youngest child's 1st b-day party that evening and was glad AP would be there to help celebrate.
3560892,"HM called AD back.  She had to work over the holidays, so she said it wasn't their best, but they are doing well.  She said AP continues to do a good job.  She said AP broke or lost her cell phone, and they are getting a new one.  She said AP will be gone with friends untiil Saturday, but she will ask AP to call AD once she gets home.  AP will start classes soon, and her 1st day of class will make her miss the January AP meeting."
3560890,AD spoke with HD Chris who reports that as usual Valentina is doing a great job with Tucker. The family has been skiing with the snow that has been present in the area and travels to their Vermont home on weekends. AP gets out socially and all is wonderful with no concerns.
3560888,"HM got back to AD.  She said they are great!  She, AP, and the kids had fun playing in the snow outside during the snow days!  She is now back in selections looking for Elissa's replacement."
3560887,AD spoke with HM who states that AP Shez is doing well and the family truly likes her. The children are connecting nicely and they are happy to have her as part of their family. HF is seeking to provide a vehicle for AP to assist in her ability to get to school/social. AO will be scheduled for 1/27.
3560886,HM Beata returned MC request. All is well with Saskia and the children. She remains interactive with them daily. AP has started taking the twins to activities.  Recently Saskia has been ill and it was discussed how to count the days regarding time.
3560874,Lucy is doing well so far. HF is pleased with her english and approach to the kids.  AP stated she likes the boys and she has spent most of her time at home while she gets settled into the routine because she thinks this is important.
3560873,AP is in Hawaii this week and will go to CA w HM and kids after she returns. AP and HF do not have any concerns currently. I spoke with HM briefly when I saw her in Redmond last week as well.
3560870,HF and AD spoke about needing a driver for the next yr. HF matched with a new ap and AP Ling will extend with a new family. AP and HF have had a good experience.
3560868,"AP is doing well with Mia. She was difficult at first, but they have a good routine. HF has no current complains and all is going well. Maria has had every AP she’s been friends with so far, rematch or go home."
3560866,HF said all is going well. They’ve had a good experience with Nerea so far. AP asked about the flu shot. The HF asked her to get it even though she didn’t want to and AP paid for it. I told her the HF should pay for it if they required it. HF also asked about insurance and AD explained AP is not responsible for the insurance for the car.
3560864,"HC had surgery in Ohio this month and AP took her vacation time while they were gone. HM expressed concerns that AP doesn’t connect with other aps and stays home most of the time. AP has only come to one activity since she arrived. AP is doing well and enjoyed the time with her family and her boyfriend who visited since the holidays. HF is back from Ohio this week and HC is doing well. Jasmin doesn’t receive emails from AD and when I noticed she had never responded to an email I’ve sent, I had her email me directly. The only way I can email her is to reply to an email she’s sent. (gmx.de domain email)"
3560862,HM was very unhappy about the insurance change and the lack of notice to au pairs prior to the change because APs could not access the ID card on Jan 1st and AP had pneumonia and need to be seen. I checked in with AP several times to discuss insurance and how she was doing. (There have been many cases of pneumonia among HC in the area as well.) AP is doing better and attended the activity on Jan 6th.) Otherwise all is well.
3560860,"AP is very happy and loves the kids. HM said she still isn’t careful with things, but she loves the boys and has a great relationship with them. She is also a hard worker. The AP and HM have expressed no other concerns. Their extension starts in Feb."
3560858,HM and AP have expressed no concerns. HM asked for APs last working date because they will most likely put younger HC in daycare and AP will extend with another family. AP is doing well and gave AD info of a family interested in the program.
3560856,"HM tried to cancel driving lessons, but couldn’t with late notice. AP had 4 lessons in one day and took the driving test the following day and passed. HM is hesitant about the APs driving, but otherwise all is well. AP is also more settled and has discussed the scheduling issue with HM. She misunderstood and HM asked her to start early and end early. AP enjoys the kids. The HM would like to continue the match and reevaluate driving in April."
3560854,"HM asked about F1 visa for AP which I cannot advise on. I talked to AP about her plans for after the program and she will most likely return home. She thinks the F1 visa is very expensive. HM said she will consider an in country, but they are on the fence about finding another ap next yr. They will only need 10-15 hrs of childcare once carter starts school in the fall."
3560852,"HM and AP both report all is well. AP is friends with another AP she arrived with. They traveled to CA over the holidays and AP is getting settled into the routine. AP Is quiet, but responsible and HM said so far things are going well. Sometimes the 3 yr old gives ap a hard time and asks for the old AP."
3560850,HM and AP both report they are very happy. The HF is in Hawaii while the home is being renovated after a major water leak caused damage to the top floor.
3560835,Everything is great! We are so fortunate to have MJ. She is so sweet and caring.
3560828,see mediation notes
3560826,Danielle says Caro is wonderful and she has no concerns or questions at this time
3560821,Everything is fine.
3560819,"Barbara says things are going very well. Her only questions were regarding her next program year. Thalia has said that she will not be extending, so HF is aware they'll need to start looking for a new AP ""soonish"". I reminded her that the application fee is waived for repeat host families. Also, they will be moving to Ohio at the end of this year, so I need to check if APC services that area."
3560814,Everything is great. Clara is great. We have a deep appreciation for her. This is our 7th au pair so we're pretty familiar with the program.
3560809,"Melissa says everything is great, they just hate to see June coming so fast."
3560794,Great Maria is leaving in August. Told her to repeat about 4 months prior. HF eager to repeat now!
3560792,Ilya says Karla is doing great! They are very happy and nothing to report..Everything is good!
3560788,Good
3560783,HM said things are much better with Ana but not perfect. They wanted to know when does their contract end. They are not sure if they will continue with the au pair program. They want to keep all options open.
3560777,Spoke to HM several times this month. They are very happy with Timo and they hope he will extend. HF said he is little homesick for his friends in CA. He has a hard time meeting more people here. He is a good friend with AP Florinda and he got in touch with other male au pair in the group.
3560774,"HF went to Chicago over the Christmas break,  AP had a friend from Colombia visiting and they had a great time as well."
3560773,Host mom staying home for a month and is training Fiona for when she returns to work in March. Host dad had some concerns about her as she didn't know how to change a diaper. He thought she had more experience. Most of her experience on her application was age 3-5 in a day care.
3560770,Going well. They want to extend. She is super happy with Nayra.
3560760,All is well
3560758,HD said that all is good with Barbara. She attends classes in the morning as she start working usually at noon or 1pm
3560753,AD spoke to HM and she says that everything is going really great. HM thanked AD for encouraging AP to think about her future when she returns home.
3560745,All is well
3560744,All is well. They went to Hawaii together and had a nice time together
3560742,Overall HM said the boys like AP and AP does do a good job but AP sometimes frustrates HM.  HM will have AP come skiing with HF in March but will not pay for him to ski because she is afraid he will be too tired after a day of skiing on his off hrs to work.  HM stated AP did this when they were in CO.
3560740,Fine.  Maravet said they are having no problems with Simone.  The baby is doing well.  Simone is taking good care of their daughter.  Maravet said that when Simone leaves they will not be replacing her with another au pair.  They are going to hire a nanny until Maravet starts clinic work in a year.  They believe they will need to get an au pair to supplement the work the nanny will be doing.
3560737,"All good here!  Anny is good with the kids and seems to be very comfortable socially;  HF does not have to worry about her at all!  She wants to go back to Mexico in March for her vacation, so I told mom it was all fine..."
3560733,Spoke with HM and everything is going well. AP is having a little difficulty with son and they are giving Ap tips on how to handle him. They are pleased with ho she is trying and her abilities.
3560727,"Aurore arrived today.  I've talked a couple of times with Betsy this month about her arrival.  Betsy has to be out of town working so Jeff will be picking Aurore up at the airport.  Betsy's Mom will be helping out until Betsy comes home.  She said she hopes to be home by 1 Feb.  We set up the orientation for Wednesday, Jan 29th at 6 p.m."
3560721,Great!  They are down to their last moth with Weroika and can't believe it is coming to an end!  She is going to stay with them and do some weekend trips during her travel month;  no big plans.  They have enjoyed having an au pair but found alternate - afternoon only - childcare moving forward.
3560703,Very well.
3560699,Good. HF will be getting an AP from another agency. AD wished the HF well and said we hope hey come back to us in the Future.
3560695,"both AP's came to Jan outing, completed APO for Agnes on 1/22, everything is going well, great communication, first time they have had an AP drive"
3560691,Melissa made it to LA but didn't make it back in time for our outing
3560643,"Met with HD and Natacha for the A/O. Reviewed expectations, rules and schedule. HD Jeff said that Natacha has been doing a great job and the girls really like her. HD Jeff said that Natacha had an accident last Thursday. Maura was in the car and told Jeff that it wasn't Natcha's fault. They think the other driver was texting. Explained that Natcha would be responsible for $250. He said that he did not want her to pay for the damage. He said that is why he has insurance."
3560637,"they are all loving the new arrival. Sashka is a help, mostly with the other kids but does hold the baby or change her when Annika is busy with one of the other kids. HM goes back to work in June so she is thinking about a July arrival. current 2 and 3 year old will be in pre school 3-t and th and 4 -m,w,f  so definitely need a good driver encouraged HF to go to FR and apply in a couple months, to look overseas first"
3560597,Everything is going good. Family is very busy. Living in a rental for the month and then will move into a new home in February. Advised HM to let me know new address and that I will need to do a home visit.
3560590,AD spoke with HM and HM said her AP is great.  AP lost her passport a couple of months ago and AP will travel to NYC tomorrow to meet with the Cezch Embassy on Monday to apply for a new passport.
3560585,AD spoke with HM and HM said that her AP is doing a good job of  settling into her job and is very proactive with the girls.  Everyone is adjusting well so far.
3560558,Well
3560557,HM told me that all is well.  Chris found a ESL pronunciation class at UC Berkeley and HM is concerned that it's too far away and asked for advice. I did a search online and sent her a long email with info on options. HM called to thank me and ask to confirm how much they are responsible for paying.
3560539,"So far, so good.  AP is coming out of her shell more every day.  HD took her for her SS card today and has been practicing driving with her.  HD said she is bonding well with all 3 HC.  He mentioned AP took out his guitar the other day, sat down on the floor with the kids and played.  The HC were enthralled and it really warmed them up to her."
3560525,"Great ( HD was funny, he said ""she only annoys he a few times a week) He was joking of course.  HF adores this EXT AP and would like her to stay forever."
3560517,good. HF missed interview last night. And needs an extension with AP but system won't grant her that. They are very interested in matching with her. ME did not call her back. Erika Del Pilar Bueno Herrera. AP also spoke with step kids mother yesterday and that went well. AP is speaking with Thelma tonight. HM wanted to know the breakdown of fees if she does not do family friendly payment plan. AD was unsure and let her know that she would get back to her.
3560496,Things are going great.  HM and AP have discussed extending and HM believes she will extend for a year.  I let the HM know the deadline for the extension is May 1st.  HM says the AP plans to apply when her class ends at the end of March.
3560490,everything is going really well all is good.
3560473,called Sarah who says all is great with Adriana
3560464,Things are going well.  Shy is taking a bit to adjust to the change but HD is confident she will come around.  Noa finished her intense chemo last week and will start a milder treatment next week.  AP is doing well with the kids overall
3560461,"Spoke with HM Page and she said things are moving forward with AP as well as she can expect. HM said AP seems intelligent and likes to learn about the family and many things about her experience here in US. HM said it is a change from Varol, who was much quieter. HM said she is enjoying the more adult- like conversations she is having with AP."
3560407,going great
3560398,Everything is OK. No major changes since AD and HM spoke last time.
3560378,"AD spoke with HM, she is happy with AP, she says she is good with the kids, she is responsible and has done well in making friends and getting out."
3560374,"AD spoke with HM who is pleased with AP, she finds her to be very smart and independent, someone who engages the family, and really cares, The hf is very happy with her and looks forward to extending with her."
3560368,Things are going well.  AP and her boyfriend and sister joined the family on christmas eve for a bit and that was enjoyable.  HM will be traveling next week so the kids will be sleeping at their dads.  AP will just need to pick them up from school and then take them to their dads after dinner.
3560366,So far it is going well.  Cris is making a strong effort to get to know the children and to bond with them.
3560356,"AD spoke with HM, who says thigns are not better or worse, AP is a very nice and responsible young lady, HM is still disappointed with the APs English skills. She finds her to be kind and warm, but not someone she would extend with"
3560355,"AD spoke with HM and HM aid things are going well.  HM said that her boys are mean to the AP but that the AP talks to the HM about it, the boys get in trouble and have to apologize to the AP.  HM sid that the boys are mean to her on purpose because they want their past AP to come back because she let the do anything they wanted and AP Angelie does not.  HM is still happy with the AP and is glad that she has thick skin."
3560341,"HM called me back. She stated that things are great, she added that she's really happy with Noey."
3560337,"Hmom reports that they still are having issues/concerns of Clemence's disposition around them and/ or around the house. Mom reports they have had several discussions with her: namely her lack of interaction with them: lack of conversation (she does not speak to them, unless spoken to and then responds with one syllable), lack of any emotional display. For example, they showed her a dent in the door of the Lexus, the car that AP drives, they asked her if she knew anything about it?  AP said no and showed no reaction and had not comment. Mom says that what AP feels or thinks stays locked in her head. Hmom also recently discovered after speaking with AP re: her lack of energy and being tired every morning, that AP has a sleep problem.  Hmom wondered why this was not disclosed to them. Mom says it affects the way AP takes care of daughter Siri.  Mom reports that AP gets the routine fine, but does not stimulate Siri very much and has very little initiative around her. Mom says AP does not like the snow so getting daughter to go out and play outside when the weather allows has not been possible. Mom says APs lack of interaction is making them feel very uncomfortable to be around her, especially around Hdad, as Hmom says AP has been known to stare at him without saying a word for several minutes. Hmom  says they are working on these issues and trying to resolve them: but would also like me to address with AP."
3560312,"Spoke to Hmom they are concerned about whether or not AP will be able to gain the designated amount of weight that APs parents requested of her within the next 3-4 weeks.  If she does not gain that weight by 2/24 then APs parents will force her to return home.  Hmom does not feel this is going to happen and is going to be out of childcare as AP will have to return home. Hmom asked about re-matching and the financials of doing so.  I told Hmom I would discuss the situation with RM and get back to her.  In the meantime, Hmom reports that AP continues to do well with her childcare.  Mom says AP is looking forward to her friends visit and going to Miami in Feb."
3560301,Very well looking forward to the extension.
3560300,"Things are going very well, AP is thinking of extending for a year ."
3560297,"things are going very well, HF thinks this has been the best AP"
3560296,I spoke to Madeline and she said they are doing well.  She said they got their extension application in for Daniela and I told her I had gotten an email stating her application was in but we need Daniela to submit her part of the aupair extension application.  I let her know what she needs to do to complete that process and she said she will when she gets home from work.  She said Daniela really enjoyed the meeting last month.
3560291,Spoke with Hm and everything is good.  Getting ready for Ap to leave. HF will not be staying with the program as they have someone else in mind to take care of HC.
3560289,"Spoke with Charlotte.  Rebecca arrived yesterday and is soaking it all in.  Alex, the nanny, and Fannie (outgoing AP) are helping her learn the job and she will be starting on Monday.  The next few days are just relaxation and learning the routine."
3560288,"AP is doing ok, she damaged the car and garage and run up a cost of $3000. HM was contemplating of letting AP leave early since she is looking for a new job but, then she needs to go to interviews and needs to have AP pick up her children."
3560286,I spoke to Andrea and she said they are doing well.  She said she is much better now with her health and that really helps out.  She said her husband is deployed now but will return next week.  She said they are thinking about another aupair but she doesn't really need the 45 hours so they may just get a nanny locally.  I told her to reapply and look at the other aupairs and see if she may find one she likes.  I mentioned getting an in country aupair too at least through the summer.  She said she will think about it.  I told her to let me know if she needed anything and I hoped they would continue with the program.  She thanked me for the call.
3560278,I spoke to Krissy and she said so far things are going well.  We have the APO set up for tonight at 5:30.  She said they got her a cell phone and her social security card on the way.  She said that Sarka really enjoyed meeting the other aupairs at the meeting and me and she is really happy with her.  She said it was perfect timing for her to meet the others.  She thanked me for driving her to the meeting.
3560260,Met with HM Amira and Maria for the A/O. Discussed expectations and rules. HM said that things were off to a good start and that Noa and Maria had a good rapport with each other.

3560156,"Everything is fine. HM apologized for not calling back yet, she has been very busy. AD let HM know she understands and just wanted to touch base quickly and will check in again soon."
3560135,Bea is great. She is a trooper when it comes to dealing with the teens. She is really calm and flexible and it takes a lot to upset her
3560120,Spoke with Carla. She said everything is fantastic with Brenda. She thinks of her as an A+ au pair.
3560102,"Great!  Flora is fitting in well, she has gotten her social security card and enrolled at Santa Monica College."
3560099,things are going great e only  wish Laura was staying we really like her. HF referred HF Vivian
3560091,"Hd got back to AD and things are going well , no questions or concerns at this time"
3560087,"Hd called AD back things are going well, HD will be traveling to Hong Kong until 1/31"
3560082,Melissa says she  is settling in and   is hoping Natalia will join a school soon.Natalia is doing great and they are very happy.
3560077,Going well but ending soon. See below.
3560075,"Great, Ap struggled a bit over holidays and was a little homesick. HM was aware and talked with her a lot and she made it through just fine. AP is talking a weekend class in San Francisco in Spring."
3560062,"Well. HM has been working in Stamford, which is an easier commute.  AP told her we had talked about her figuring out where she should do her credits. But, everything is going well."
3560057,Well- excited to extend with DjiDji.
3560018,Not great- see note below.
3560015,"things are fine with Bruna, no questions and all rules are being followed, going to Boston for the weekend to take the children to a hockey tournament, will check in again next month"
3560008,Family is very happy with Lara
3560006,HM says all is going really great!  HM says AP has been so helpful in so many ways and they just care bare the thought of her leaving.
3560004,great
3559999,Great.  HF very happy with AP. She is in Orlando with friends.  Is going to take BMCC DC course and they need to figure out the rest.
3559994,Good
3559985,Well. AP had friends visit and all went well.  AP starting NCC next week.  Everything is going well.  Barclay is due in March and feeling good. HM will give AP time off to attend 2/3 meeting.
3559979,HM says all is going well.  HM asked about what it takes to extend with AP.  HM thinks AP might be willing to extend for 6 more months.
3559970,"HM says things are good.  HM has been busy with work and AP has been very helpful in getting kids to school, fed, bathed, etc."
3559952,HM says things are going great.  HM has been traveling a bit with work and AP has been very helpful when just HD is around.
3559947,HD says things are great.  They went for the weekend to Mazama to go cross country skiing.  They rented a cabin and AP LOVED it.
3559945,"Spoke with Hm and things are going well.  Son is getting along nicely with AP.  Hm not happy about having to help Ap get Ss card, DL, etc.  AD explained that this was all gone over at arrival orientation and important documents were given to AP with directions about how to accomplish"
3559937,HM says things are going well overall.  HM says now after a year and a half they feel like AP is more comfortable.  HM says she thinks AP is introverted but very independent.  AP has had a serious boyfriend for about a year.  AP's mom and sister are coming in early May and will stay with HF for 4 days.  HF will probably not pursue another AP since daughter will be in full time pre-k next year.
3559934,They are doing better.  Emi's English is getting better and she continues to go to classes.  HM had surgery and her sister was in town.  Emi was helpful.  She has been communicating with me regularly and is attending all events which is great.
3559918,Paula said that Monica is fitting in nicely with their family.  She said the kids love her!  She is happy how everything is going.  She did say that she thinks Monica may be bored and wants more active activities.  We discussed at length the options that I have put forward in addition to other options.
3559916,"Not so happy-- AP has asked to leave during days that she is to be working; on the phone a lot while working!  Leaves dishes in the sink, playroom is a wreck, she is arguing with the kids, posted on Facebook that she is very sad. She forgot to pick up Zane from school, was arguing.  Not paying attention.  Tries to plan other elaborate playdates, rather than finding simple things to do at home"
3559913,Ashley and I had a scheduled visit which worked out so well.  We will continue to do that every month.  She is very busy with her work schedule so it is hard to connect.  She said everything is going well with Nettie.  She is looking to extend with her.  She said she is doing really well with the boys and fits in well with their family.  We discussed our monthly activities and a variety to get the girls more involved. Nettie does have friends from other au pair agencies but her good friends from our group have all gone home.  I would like to see more of her.
3559898,HM says they are still getting settled and unpacking but things are going well with AP.   I gave HM information for AP to get signed up with ESL.
3559881,"good, starting second year"
3559861,Everyone is doing well and Viola was off saying goodbye to her friend who was leaving.  Things are great and the storm that we thought was going to be dumping lots of snow only left 4 inches.  Viola stats her course on Saturday and is looking forward to that.
3559858,"Everything is awesome and great!  They are regretting not extending for a year and hm was wondering if there was anything they could do about that.  Said no, sorry that decision has to be made when applying.  They had a great holiday flew to NY with Nathalia, then she went on to Miami with friends and the family flew to Panama."
3559850,Mary Anne says that things are great and they are going to extend - they will do that as soon as Marce finishes her class at FSU and then she will have all her credits.
3559847,"Gina reports that all is well, She said that Kate is great, they are going to Las Vegas next week. No concerns."
3559845,"great, but the AP told them she will not be extending.  I talked with the family about finding a new AP."
3559778,Michelle says that things are going well and that they feel very lucky to have Katrijn   She is dedicated to doing a good job and is wonderful with the kids
3559635,Sao is starting her course at Mass Bay for the ESL intensive this week and looking forward to that.  She has lots of friends and they have been busy together.  She had a tooth problem and they are working with the insurance company for the coverage and what it will pay for.
3559631,Christine says that things are going well and they are all getting along well.  The little guy was testing her but we talked about that and how to set boundaries.  They were on their way to the gym after our meeting.
3559627,Things going better now and Christa says that Natalia is more open about how she is feeling.  She is working within Nats strengths and she thinks that this year was a real time of growth for her to stand on her own feet.
3559615,everything is going well but HM was disappointed that AP didn't spend her first couple days home from Brazil (and HF home from Hawaii) with HF but rather ran off to spend time with boyfriend.  HF feels a bit taken for granted and would like AP to spend more time with them as a family
3559591,HM says things are great.  AP is wonderful.  HD asked if they could adopt AP!
3559587,The HF is well.  They have been doing quite a bit of traveling.  They were in DC and will be in Fl and CA next month for the majority of the month.  We will check in the second week of January.  The Hm informed me that the AP is still trying to return home in order to renew her Visa so that she can travel out of country.  I explained to the Hm that this is not possible since the AP will already have a Visa and she cannot leave the country once this happens.
3559582,I left a voice mail on both home and cell number for Rekha.   mail sent asking Rekha to phone back . No response thus far.
3559581,"Overall things are well at home.  Jim and Meme still have their struggles at times.  Meme's strengths are not in the organization or household tasks that her HF puts emphasis on, they are in her childcare skills of playing and entertaining the children and showing them kindness and attention.  I mentioned to Mary that it would be wonderful if the perspective could change about who's ""job"" it is in the morning to get the children dressed and ready for school and to see the family working as a team to reach their goal instead of it being Meme's responsibility.  We spoke about them welcoming a new AP in July or no AP.  They are unsure at this time."
3559546,Kerry called me back. She said she had a great New Years.    All is going well with Daniela.   She is settling in nicely. Mom in Oregon right now for work.
3559542,Iris called me back. The match continues to go really well.  Iris and Natalia determined that Natalia will return to Poland at  the end of June.
3559537,Great. It's good to have AP back after being away for the month of December. AP went right back to work and everything is back to the usual routine.
3559528,"Hm told me that all is well. They are considering extending together, so we discussed that and I emailed HM all the info."
3559497,"AD spoke with HM.  She said they had great holidays, but she thinks she has spoiled AP too much, and that she is not pulling her fair share of the work load.  HM said she has been very aware that AP is 18, and has coddled her a lot.  She likes that AP does not go out and party, or have same issues as previous APs, but feels AP is not taking enough initiative to get her own tasks done.  HM has put a checklist in place for AP, and said she is seeing improvement.  She will keep AD posted how it goes.  She said they will not extend with this AP, but will get a new AP for next year."
3559496,Very well.  We discussed the fact that Anna was upset about having to pay taxes.  She said she had no idea previously.  Anna still has time to save the money but she is not happy obviously.
3559489,Very well.  HM said they were only keeping AP Lorena for the first six months.  They have another family lined up to take her for the remaining 6 months.  She said AP is aware of this.  I asked her to have the potential HF call me.  They live in Riverwoods which is still my area.  I put the lead into Casper.
3559479,"HD told me that all is well with Yasmim. He needed a clarification regarding vacation days, whether they were 10 or 14 days. I explained."
3559474,"Leslie reports that things are good with Heemin, but it's just been a crazy month. Leslie's aunt just passed away, so they have travelled to GA for a funeral. She's also been working night shift as a nurse, so she's been exhausted. She says that Heemin's sister is coming to visit in February, and they are all very excited for her and excited for the opportunity to meet her sister."
3559471,"HM returned my call.  They are still having issues with AP not taking charge of the children.  HM says AP is afraid of conflict and therefore will not say no to the girls and the girls are walking all over her.  HM also said that AP is still struggling with her English, yet is wanting to take a business course rather than an English course, despite both AD and HM's suggestion that English would be more beneficial to her.  HM also says that AP has been meeting people over an internet chat line for Chinese people and that she most recently left to go out during the recent snowstorm with a man she met in the chat room.  HF is worried for her personal safety. HF has had multiple conversations with AP about all of this.  They do not want to break the match at this point.  AD offered to come out and have a conversation/mediation but HF says they are not ready for that yet.  AD will, however, speak to the AP separately about these issues."
3559464,"HM apologized for missing AD's call, as she was in a meeting.  She said everything is going well."
3559450,"Not well at all.  She said this is not what she paid for and not what she expected based on Bea's application.  She does not seem like a teacher at all and does not engage the children, and other eople comment on this as well.  She does not come up with things to do.  HM Teah was sitting upstairs cutting out shapes for a learning activity for the kids, and Bea just sat there watching them play an ipad.  She didn't ask to help, texts all day and is not engaging.  She hasn't come up with any learning activities.  Teah said she has written out everything and talked to her about this but she shows n enthusiasm, she doesn't talk much to them and she has done a fewthings that concerned Teah, leaving the garage door closed when the car is on while loading them. They are in Arizona now and Bea came and asked Teah when they were leaving.  Teah asked if she looked at the schedule given to her on Janaury 1.  She hadn't and thought they were leaving on Sunday rather than Tuesday.  Teah said she is at the end of her rope and will give her an ultimatum on Sunday, step it up or go home.  She won't have another AP unless Carla can come because she has been sorely disappointedinthe las two.  She relaizes that triplets are hard, but she doesn't seem to be trying.  AD going there Wednesday at 11 am for mediation."
3559429,"HM got back to AD.  She said AP has been very flexible and super about the snow days and late school start times.  She said she has been sledding with the girls, and also doing crafts with them."
3559426,HM says AP continues to be a good fit and part of the family.  They went to Chicago over the holidays so AP was able to explore the city in her time off.
3559421,"Pavlina continues to do a great job. HM shared she met her boyfriend and she likes him and she said Pavlina deserves to be happy. HM shared Pavlina is very mature, responsible and a very hard working girl. HF is not sure if they will continue with the Program after Pavlina leaves in June"
3559416,"HM got back to AD.  She said AP is doing a great job with the kids, and they are pleased.  AP has been keeping them going with lots of crafts and indoor activities since it is so cold outside."
3559411,It has been a busy month for HF. HM is traveling at the moment. HF bought a new house and they are doing major remodeling on it. They are not sure when they will move in but they will let me know. Iveth is doing a very good job.
3559408,Ale is trying to speak Spanish to the kids more and she is trying to engage with them but HM is still not satisfied with the childcare Ale is providing. She said she is not making connection with the boys and she is now not speaking Spanish to Kate.
3559405,"HD got back to AD.  He said it has been a hectic time for all of them.  HM continues to work night shifts at the Pentagon.  Once she is done with that, they have planned a trip to Disneyworld for early February, and will be taking AP and the boys.  They are very excited.  He thought AD had incorrect phone number for AP--AD checked and did have a wrong number, so HD provided AD with new one."
3559395,Good
3559388,HM says Megan does a great job with the boys.  Things have changed somewhat since HM's mom has moved in and HM had questions about AP rematching since the grandmother wants to care for the boys.  AD went over rematch for AP and refund for HF.
3559384,HD is happy with AP's care of Alicia.  They get along really well and he was happy that AP was excited to travel with them.
3559383,"Spoke with Hm and everything is good. Ap had an accident, everyone ok, was hit by a dear. Discussed $250 that AP is responsible towards deductible."
3559381,HM still unsure about AP since she doesn't do much with the family.  HM said she would give a week's notice about schedule changes.
3559373,Spoke with Hd and everything is going well. They think Ap is terrific and would like to extend with her but Ap does not want to extend.
3559366,spoke with Hm and things are wonderful. Has been trying to help Ap get final payment from prior HF.  Hf on vacation.
3559364,"Spoke with Hd and things are ok, Ap has seemed to be slacking on responsibilities. Ap has forgotten to take Hc to Dr. appts and activities.  HD feels that she is spending a lot of time with boyfriend and is starting to realize that she will need to leave soon.  Hd has had conversations with Ap about her performance and hopes that things will return to normal."

She asked me if Katja ever contacted me about that, and I stated ""no"" but I assured HM that I would follow up with Katja and see if I can help her. She said that they have been busy. Katja went to TX last weekend to visit a friend and the HF went to Daytona for a cheerleading competition. They will go to Savannah next weekend for another one.

She has been going to see Greg every night and has come back in late in the morning 3 times, andsometimes tired.  She scratched the side of the car, but Laura isn't going to fix it.  When Lauren seems tired she is snappier and has snapped at Zander a few times.  Laura said he is very sensitive.  Also HM Laura spent $500 on the class for Lauren, which will not get her all of the credits, and it is 20 miles away, or about 80-90 miles per week, around $200 extra in gas.  She thinks this is too much as she has already paid $500.  Laura said Lauren thinks she should only have to pay $15 for gas a week for personal use because all she does is go to Greg's.  Laura said she goes othe places, to meet people for coffee and to see other friends too and she doesn't think she realizes how much money she is spending.  It was $150 last week alone and 900 miles since she started Jan. 2.  Also, she used Laura's credit card while out one day and wanted Laura to take it out of her check.  I told her she couldn't do that.  Laura said she was going to talk to Lauren about being more senstitive to Zander and Hadley, and also about being late or not ready at 6:30 am, but then today she discussed the gas and nothing else.  She said she would rather bring it up as it comes up.  I said she should not stew over things and bring up things that have been a problem just recently as well because if it happens again she will be angry but Lauren won't know it has been building.  I also told her I wanted to talk to Lauren about these issues and she asked me to wait until next week beause she wouldn't have time until the weekend to talk to her."

3558069,"AD spoke to HM and she says that things are really great with her AP and sadly she will be returning home in a couple weeks. AD reminded HM that AD will make one more monthly call in Feb. and M.W. will be calling to follow-up after Feb. 6.    *HM states that they will not be renewing with APC because APC does not have a variety of SA APs in the pool. HF has had a very positive experience with their SA AP and only wants to focus on SA APs. Therefore, the HF decided to go with another agency and is hosting another SA AP.   AD thanked HF for their years of participation in the program and asked HF to keep APC in mind in the future."

3557771,"Spoke with HM. Going for Orie. today. They have been having a few issues with AP not doing what they have asked. AP was not writing down what the kids were eating, AP keeps putting good knives in dishwasher when repeatably asked not to. AP is not ready for work when she comes upstairs. She eats breakfast when she starts work and should eat before she starts. She has overslept once. Also yesterday she took the kids out with another AP when it was really too cold to go out and took the other AP's child in the car too and she was not in a car seat. I have called other HF and alerted them to this so they can speak to their AP about this. I will address all these issues with AP today. HF is very frustrated and upset at this point."

3557717,Jennifer says Alba is thinking about extending for 6 months.  Jen would have loved to have a year but that is alright.  Snow day today and all the kids are home and they are having fun.

3557701,AP is doing well and they will extend. AD gave extension info and sent links for applications. AP is still considering number of months.
3557699,The HM reported that all is going well with the AP and she has no concerns.  the HM asked the AD if she can find out her tax information as she is not able to print it from the APC website.  the Hm also mentioned that she called SF several times and was not able to get through.  The phone seemed as if it was not working.  The AD will follow-up with an email to SF requesting this information for the HM.
3557697,"AD spoke with HM.  She said she and her husband are working today even with the snow, and AP is home with the kids.  They continue to be pleased with Yada, and have no issues."
3557696,AP continues to do well and HF is happy. They are most likely going to Israel for summer leaving June 24 or 25 and AP will be able to rematch early and match with HF for extension year. AD told HM to start looking in April.
3557689,Going very well.  Aline is helpful and doing a great job.
3557685,going well. She is looking for a new AP and I told her if she had any questions let me know. She is going to try to interview some this weekend.

3557679,AP is doing great. Fits in well with HF and they all like her very much. She helps out and takes initiative.
3557675,"AD spoke with HM.  She said her placement continues to go well.  She said AP is home with the boys today for the snow day.  AP wants to extend for an additional 6 months, and is hoping to find a new HF on the west coast.  HM asked various questions about this transition, which AD answered."
3557667,HF loves AP.  She does a great job.  No issues.
3557653,AD spoke with HM.  She said she and her husband are still working today even with the snow.  She said all is going fine.
3557643,AD spoke with HM. She feels the relationship is strong and the placement is good. HM asked ap to extend but ap feels she will definitely return to her family and fiancé. HM asked about FR. AP is attending and English class and will take a weekend class in Chicago.
3557636,"AD spoke with HM, who says ap is very good with the kids but HM sometimes feels like the ap is taking advantage. HM has recently changed the car use regulations because HM wants a car with car seats at home when mom and kids are home, which means ap can not use the car in most weekday evenings. There was an insure with the ap requesting that the HM buy her an iPhone with a data plan. HM says ap can be seen on social media during work times and she doesn't want to encourage this more."
3557633,AD spoke with HM who says placement is okay. HM says AP lacks the ability to engage with the kids. HM says the kids want to play and to talk with her but won't tell her that because they said they don't want to bother her. HM had a sit down meeting with AP after the new year and went over each other's expectations.
3557604,"HM called AD.  Her current AP let her know that she was upset that HM asked her to not eat the HF's meat every day, as HM had plans to use that for dinners.  AP had been upset by this, and felt HM was being cheap.  AP had advised HM not to put a limit on AP's eating for a future AP.  HM said she and AP had already spoken about it and worked through it, but wanted to know how to prevent an upset like this in the future.  AD discussed having many food items available that AP can eat, but maybe having a special shelf or sticker she puts on food she did not want AP to eat because she was saving it for another meal.  HM said AP likes to cook large meals with meat every day at lunch, and that takes a lot of time out of her work day, and is expensive.  She wondered if she is required to provide daily meat.  AD explained that HF is required to provide food and housing, but AD thought it was reasonable for AP to have meat available for 3-4 lunches per week instead of every single day.  HM said she always has sandwich meat, eggs, etc, available, but felt that AP using her beef and chicken daily was excessive.  HM said she will set expectation clearly for next time."
3557572,"According to HM, the placement is going ok.  HM would like to see AP participate with the family a little more.  She is looking for that family link.  HM's father recently passed and with the stress of the holidays and being pregnant has left the family going through a lot lately."
3557556,"HM told me all is well. They only had one issue since last month when a mom from the Italian school Éva attends, mentioned to HF that Myriam was using her phone a lot. HF spoke to her about it and everything has been fine since."
3557544,"Tammy said it came fast, and they aren't quite ready, but they will get ready by Thursday.  We scheduled the APO for the week after next because Carol is going to train her and Tammy has exams. Nate is very attached and she is a little worried about that but Carol has been telling them about the new Carol."
3557543,AP spoke with HM yesterday. HM reports everything with AP continues to go well.  HF has not decided if they will continue with an AP after this one leaves.
3557540,"Well.  They really like and enjoy Katharina and she is great with Felix.  She has been very helpful and she only has to wake him up once a week because Katharina does it the other days.  She can see how this will be even more helpful when the baby comes too.  She is able to rest a lot and gives her more immediate feedback now.  After the cell conversation she immediately started putting it on the counter when she works and isn't on it as much at all, so now they talk more regularly.  She is very easy-going and eay to be around, but the only thing that concerns her is that she doesn't reach out a lot ot other au pairs so she spends all of her off time with them too.  They don't really mind except it gets expensive to have her at every brunch, but they feel too bad to make her pay herself for Starbucks or anything.  I will try to connect her with others."
3557537,HM reports placement continues to go well. She is excited that they have agreed with AP to extend for another year.  HM feels that they have been very lucky to have found an AP who is such a good fit with their personality and work ethics.  Discussed extension process and deadline.
3557535,"Not so well.  She said Vilde is very much a teen girl.  She doesn't do things if she isn't the one who did it...pick up a glass someone else left out, or move the kids laundry if she didn't do the wash.  Today she had to be woken up for work and then dropped the kids off to play at a place and didn't stay with them, which HM said is ok because they have phones, but isn't great, and then when she brought them back home again she went to her room.  Then tonight she asked to get off early to go be with her friends and Hm let her.  I said HM needed to be very clear about what her duties are and when she is working and that it should also be very clear that she should not be in her room during work time.   She will talk to her and call me back."
3557519,"Everything is going very well.  HF is hoping that AP will decide to extend with them at least for a little while.  Everyone is very pleased with AP, as she is very sweet and kind to all."
3557502,"Susan said things are great - she came home early from work due to the snow storm and were about to have dinner, but Karen is doing a great job and has made a lot of friends. They are talking about an extension."
3557495,Ursula says Jana continues to be great! They are very happy. Had a nice holiday with all the cousins. The girls love Jana!
3557494,"AD spoke with Clay, H's husband, and Clay told AD that the AP is great.  AP just returned from a family trip to St. Louis and they were happy that he joined hem  AP is cooking for the children and that is going well right now."
3557483,they are all so sad to see their au pair leave but are looking forward to Fany coming.  She said that they have a few parties that her friends have made to say 'bye.  I told Shannon I would send Fany the welcome packet.
3557480,AD spoke with HM on 1/20/2014 and HM told AD that everything is going well with her AP.  HM said that she has not spent a lot of time talking with her new AP but that they have sent emails back and worth.
3557476,Spoke with Hm and everything is going well. Hm did speak to Ap about extension and Ap is deciding. Hm told Ap that she will need an answer by March.
3557470,"Spoke with Hm and everything is terrific. Ap is a wonderful young lady and is doing well with the HC. HM has been home because she will be starting a new job soon, so has had the opportunity to spend time with Ap."
3557465,"Spoke with HM and everything is ok, Not sure they want to extend with current Ap and are still deciding. Told Hm to reapply if she wants to start looking for a new Ap. Discussed repeat family discount and  early bird discount."
3557462,"Spoke with HM and everything is ok, Not sure they want to extend with current Ap and are still deciding. Told Hm to reapply if she wants to start looking for a new Ap. Discussed repeat family discount and  early bird discount."

3557367,Spoke with Hm and everything is going well.  Likes to start the looking process early so will start next month.
3557365,HD admitted part his fault for allowing AP to briefly talk on phone while working and not setting curfew and it got out of hand.  HD stated all is better now and AP was receptive to changes. HD stated AP now has a boyfriend.
3557348,"I called HM and left messages on 1/4, 1/21, 1/27, 1/29, 1/30. I emailed her on 1/29 asking her to phone me for the check in. I also left a message for the AP, asking if the HM might be out of the country or perhaps she has a new phone number. Emailed HD on 1/31. At that point the HM finally got back to me. She apologized for ignoring my calls but they have been busy going to the mountains every weekend. HM says the AP is great; very helpful."
3557330,Good.
3557308,Good. She is doing really well and the HC is comfortable with her already

She is great and the kids love her but they want a different experience and are very interested in a French AP. They have an AP they interviewed that they really like and will speak with her further this weekend.
3557242,HM says that AP is doing well. AP just got back from a trip to Disneyland.
3557239,"AP is doing well. Their only problem has been that AP will use the car and leave the gas tank empty. We talked about various ways to calculate how much she should pay for gas. I suggested that AP could pay for all the gas and HM could reimburse at the end of the week. Or, perhaps they could give her a prepaid visa card for gas and then she could pay them for what she uses. It seems like AP just doesn't want to take the time to go to the gas station. Otherwise, everything is fine. HM was on her way home from Hawaii when she called. AP was there with them for 5 days and then came home."
3557235,"Hm and I spoke about Yukano and her burn on her leg. HM called Golden Gate Urgent Care on Lombard Street and made sure they take United HealthCare.  Yukano will go there at 7pm this evening to see a doctor and get treated. Otherwise, all is well."

She said all eas great other wise

We talked about if she goes home to renew then there would be the possibility of it getting denied although it is not common.  We went over the exension fees and the application process.  I also told her I met with Yudy in person on Friday and I already printed off the information for her as well as the tax information she had questions on.

3557052,AP has adjusted well to the HF.  AP spent the majority of the holidays with the HF.  HM said AP did not seem homesick over holidays.  AP was able to speak to parents often.  AP went out with friends on New Years Eve.  AP finally got  SS card...had gotten lost in the mail.  AP then passed drivers license and driving test.  AP is driving car to visit friends.

3557015,Jai says Yuria continues to be  great. They are having a good year! She is good with the children.
3557013,I left a voice mail on Theresa 's cell phone and will try again.
3557010,"AD spoke to HD.  Everything is going okay, not great, but okay.  AP is a sweet girl but can be a little annoying sometimes.  They have decided they can live with her until the end of her program in May.  Their HC are older and they are not likely to renew so don't want to rematch at this point. HD asked AD to call his office number for future MCs. 973-763-2777."
3557008,HM says that they are great and had a nice holiday. She says that all is great with AP and no concerns.
3557007,Spoke briefly to HD. All is well. Nella is doing a great job
3556984,AP has adjusted extremely well to HF.  AD remarked how AP had sent her a recipe to a spanish omelet recipe.  AP is very thoughtful.  AP has made good friends in the cluster.  HM is traveling to NYC the last week of Jan.  AP may have to work the night of the social but HM will see if her mother can work that evening so AP can attend
3556973,Things are good. I'm leaving tomorrow for Africa. Kids are enjoying Rens. Would like her to pick-up after kids more. Will talk to her later today.
3556962,"Great! HF loves AP and the fact that she likes to spend her ""off"" time as part of their family. As long as things continue to go as well as they have, the HF will consider asking AP to extend for 6 mos. after her program end date. At that time, their oldest child will be of driving age so they will no longer need a driver and it gets the HP's through ""tax season""."
3556940,It is great so far.  Barbra is a real go-getter. She is on top of everything.  She got her SS card in 3 days!
3556926,HM says that they are anxiously awaiting AP's arrival. She says that HD will be picking AP up at hotel in NJ.
3556917,Everything is going well.  AP is doing a great job and HF is still very pleased.  HF got a puppy over the holidays and HM said that AP has been a big help.
3556916,Kate said that they are doing fine. She did ask how much she has to contribute towards Paola's education for the 6 month extension period and I explained it was $250.
3556913,Betsy said that everything is going well and they are leaning towards not extending with Vivi and taking a break from the program for the summer. They will decide and have that talk with her soon.
3556908,Good! Things are running smoothly.
3556863,"Things are going ok, there has been one instance where the ap stayed out overnight on a work night and host mom addressed with her - ap thought that it was ok as the hm had allowed her to stay out overnight during the holidays but the ap was not clear that this was not allowed. Host mom explained that they had a house full of guest and that was why she allowed ap to sleep at her friends. host mom said that she does not want to make a change with the ap as they babies are very sensitive to change and suffer with some stranger anxiety."
3556853,Everything is going well.  HM is very pleased with AP and her son adores him.  There was one issue in which the AP was smoking ant this did not go over well.  AP and HM talked through the issue and AP assured her that this would not happen again.  AP is not sure if he will extend or not.
3556802,very well host mom is a little worried about the transition for one ap to the next but is excited to welcome Nakita into their home. This year has been a very positive experience and host mom is hopeful that they can repeat the experience.
3556794,Everything is great.  HF would like AP to extend.  AP still has some things to think about (boyfriend at home).  HM is considering staying home after the AP leaves.
3556785,AP is not extending with HF which does not come as a surprise since the AP always said she wanted a one year experience. HM wants to start looking for new AP but asked what to do with the last week since they will be traveling on spring break.
3556781,Marta just arrived on 1/7/14
3556761,Ap has completed her year and host family are not looking for a replacement at this time as hm is not working. Ap and family had a nice fairwell dinner and are sad to say goodbye.
3556744,"Things are going well with Ap, Hm is getting ready for the new Ap to arrived Thursday . Hm has all pick up information"
3556689,Realy well host family would love to be able to keep that ap for a second year but the fees are above what they can afford to spend on childcare. I did go over the extension fees again but they are above the limit for the family.
3556688,"All is fine. The host parents are pleased with Justine! It makes Ruby sad to see her go in July. I sent her information about re-applying via email. Rubyfeels that insurance communication with APC is not yet resolved. The host parents want to communicate with someone in organization, not directly involved in UHC roll-out. Invited HF to 1/26 Gymboree event."
3556661,"I spoke with Jeannie at length today.  Today is the first day of their second year with Leah. She is really frustrated with Leah because she is not getting her kids to practice their musical instruments on a daily basis. Leah said that the kids don't want to practice. But, this is really important to Jeannie and she is so frustrated that she wants to break the match. I gave her some suggestions to make the practicing happen (place a list of ""to dos"" for Leah on the wall that she needs to sign off on when they are complete) as well as a similar requirement for the children.  Jeannie called me a genius and is going to talk to Leah tonight to inform her of the new process.   Jeannie said Leah is a really good, kind hearted au pair and she really likes her, so she is hoping this will work."
3556655,HM said that everything is going well and they have no issues.
3556649,HD said things are going very well.

3556620,"HM said that they came back from a long trip to France for the holidays and a death in their family, but things are going really well with AP and HM is happy about that. HM said that they will be looking for another AP because current AP's year will be ending soon."

3556616,"things are going well so far, Ap will be going with the HF skiing on 1/20"

3556592,"Everything is going well.  HD mentioned that there were a few small issues, but overall everything was fine.  HD asked how soon out they could interview for a new AP, as they believe that their AP is not planning to extend."
3556555,"Fernanda is doing a great job. She is responsible and flexible and mature, HM will start looking for a new au pair next week. 21+, experienced driver, swimmer, and well educated"

3556532,Maru is doing great with the children and seems happy. Just started new class. Had a minor car incident backing out of garage. HF will most likely go for second AP in late May.
3556529,"really well, Jess is getting more convidence and making riend and her english is improving. her riving is good and she will be taking test 2/4"
3556524,I spoke with the Host Dad. He let me know that there is a lot going on with the divorce now.   Olivia may be subpoenaed.  Asked me if we have any rules related to this for APs.  I let him know that I will check.
3556521,"Things are going well, it is an adjustment after having Elif with them for 3 years."
3556508,"Things are still going very well. The family said it is particularly great to travel with Kassie. After traveling together a fair amount for her work as well as on family trips, she and Suzanne have Dylan's travel down to an organized routine (packing lists, vacuum packed diapers, minimalist diaper bag) and Kassie now functions as a sort of executive Au Pair in that they just ask her to get D ready for a trip and the next thing they know she is packed and in the car seat. They have in fact told Kassie that she should offer to teach a travel with babies class at Au Pair academy.  They said that Kassie is great at finding fun things to do on her own when the host parents are too tired to do anything.  They said that Kassie is like a second daughter to them."
3556504,AP is settling in well with HF and things are good so far.
3556453,The HF love Bret. She is fantastic. Couldn't be happier. Great with Josh
3556452,"Great, no complaints, 'cant look a gift horse in the mouth'. Pinar seems to have found a good balance of being a friend/sister but still being able to keep Dasia in check, so happy. Glad extension all went through."
3556448,HM is sad that AP is leaving. She says that the kids are use to this process but it is sad to see her go. She said that she had a great experience with our program and will definitely refer us.
3556433,"Everything is good, Cassie was excited to go home but then missed the kids so much was more excited to come back!  She commented to hm that she doesn't know what she'll do when this second year is up!  HM has learned a lot and feels she got really lucky with Cassie.  She is a GREAT addition to their family."
3556430,"Very well they love AP she is wonderful with the baby, she is a very mature girl  HM asked me about AP renewing for 6 months in May as she has a scholarship in Brazil to honor and will have to go back I told her I would check with RM and email her when I have an answer"
3556421,"HF very happy with Jenny.  She is mature, fun and the girls already love her.  She is already bonded in well with their family and hf is looking forward to another great year!"
3556404,Hm told me that so far things are fine. Olivia has been sick for 3 days so she hasn't really started working full tie yet. She will start today and Hm will be nearby to train her. She is very sweet and HM likes that. The children are warming up to her.
3556373,"Very well Tamara feels as if Annabelle has really ""hit her stride"" with her relationship with the children, work in the home and the HF in general.  Annabelle was very helpful on their vacation to South Africa especially with the children on the plane."
3556372,great
3556361,Great.
3556353,great
3556341,Great
3556340,"Things started off great and they seemed to be doing very well.  However, HF has noticed that since AP has started hanging out with other AP's she is starting to get a little bit of an attitude or maybe a little defensive.  AP first told HF about how other AP's are complaining of working too many hours, HF changing schedule on them.... and it seemed all negative and it seems to be rubbing off on AP.  AD advised HF to talk to ap about peer pressure and negativity as well as always trying to guide the AP's to talk to AD if there are any issues and concerns as that is the only way that we can help.  Rather than being negative, try to stay positive and talk to AD.  HD said it was just a heads up for now, but they said that they are going to be sure from the beginning that they don't have a repeat of last year and they are going to be very pro-active."
3556339,Charlotte is doing well.  The kids really like her.  She helped out a lot when Sheila was sick.  She has not received her international license yet.  Her parents sent it in the mail 2 weeks ago.
3556309,great
3556305,Good
3556303,great
3556296,Great.
3556279,HM on East Coast at moment back Thurs night. Things are going well with Alex. He passed his written drive test and now just has to schedule actual test.
3556272,"Well.  AP is great and girls are great. HM busy with lectures and writing a book, so is hoping for a snow day to give her extra time."
3556264,Well.  AP has requested his return flight.  HM knows they need to get into interviews soon.  She said she will be in touch if she needs matching assistance.  Reminded her to put candidates in her interviews.
3556260,"OK AP still not very good at cleaning up kitchen after meals with HC. I told HM that she needs to be very verbal and consistent about her wishes. She said that she was going to text her daily before she was coming home to tell her what she expected. AP seems to understand better. I told her that I didn't think Dad had done the agreement with AP. I am going to send it to Mom and she said that she would go over it with AP, can't do what she doesn't know is expected. Mom said that she isn't helping keep child's laundry or area clean."
3556255,All is well. AP will overlap for a bit with new AP before she starts her vacation and travel month.
3556253,"Great. HM said they ""lucked out"" w/ AP.  Cruise was great.  No questions, comments or concerns."
3556251,"Things are great with Ari. Scott has been traveling a lot lately and Ari has been a huge help. Susan mentioned that Ari's extension officially goes through July, but Ari will be leaving in June. Discussed early departure approval form, timing of looking for new AP and incoming/outgoing AP overlap and training."
3556244,"Things are fine.  HM has been unsuccessful in getting AP to sign up for classes, as has AD.  AP seems resistant for some reason.  Discussed that AP would be unable to extend, and HM said that was fine.  AP is somewhat headstrong and doesn't always indicate when she doesn't understand instructions. AP seems a little more immature than prior APs. But she and boys like each other alot and she provides good childcare.  Evan is doing better."
3556243,First week is going very well and AP is great with the boys. We will meet Friday for arrival meeting since today's forecast with snow is too iffy.
3556236,"Things with Maria continue to be just great. Gia had questions re AP/FSA tax applications, so we discussed & resolved. They will be filing their extension application shortly."
3556232,Things with Lisa are great. The kids love her and everything continues to go well. Rose had questions re tonight's AP event as just 2 APs (including Lisa) so far are planning to attend. I sent reminder & let her know we could adjust event if it remains just the 2.
3556231,HM not sure they are extending with AP.  Probably not moving to Georgia for another year.  AP as at NCC taking placement test today.  Talked about need for CTDL if staying in CT and went over deadlines.
3556217,"Vanessa is great & Tammy is pleased that she is consistently bubbly. She has been spending a lot of time with area AP Angelica & having a more active social life. Vanessa is hoping to attend AP bowling event tonight, but is concerned about getting home late (event starts at 8). Tammy is fine with the timing and has let Vanessa know."
3556215,"HM called AD.  She said AP continues to do well.  She was forgetting to do a few things, but they made a checklist for her, and it seems since they have done that, that she has improved.  HM is very concerned about her son getting the flu.  She asked if she can require her AP to get a flu shot.  AD said HM can ask AP if she would feel comfortable getting one, and if so, AP can get one, but HM cannot require it of her.  HM understood."
3556197,Everything continues to go well with Ale. Her birthday is next week so they're planning a celebration for her.
3556183,AD spoke with HM yesterday. HM states everything is going well with AP's care of children. No new concerns.  AP does not spend much time with HF but HM states they are okay with this and feel comfortable the way things are going.
3556182,"AD spoke with HM. Things are going okay.  Not great, but not bad. AP and HM have had several issues they have had to work through but they are working through them.  The biggest issue is that AP does not seem interested in meeting other APs or seeing the area.  She spends a lot of time at home.  AD and HM explored some ideas of how to encourage her to get out of the house more. HM stated that she has tried everything and AP is not interested.  HM stated that HD stated if AP doesn't want to do that, she's not going to and they just need to accept it.  AD stated I would encourage her to attend monthly events and weekly AP gatherings in the area. Most issues have progressively improved."
3556170,AP is doing great and a good fit for the family. HM and AD spoke about second AP and what is important to HF. Most important is that the AP is a good fit with the rest of the family and willing to work with SN children
3556163,HM stated she doesn't like to confront AP too much because AP gets weird. AD suggested going over schedule and duties to make sure AP knows her expectations of HF. AD will call AP to ask if she has any questions about her duties and go over what she is expected to do.
3556142,All is well. AP continues to do a good job and oldest HC is still a challenge for all.
3556137,"Things are going very well , HM thinks AP is a great fit with the boys"
3556129,"All is well with AP. No concerns or questions. AP is not as outgoing as previous AP and does not really take initiative but he is polite and always asks if he can go out, take care etc. AD asked HM for help for another HF who is looking for a male AP."
3556108,"It's going well. No additional concerns noted since last conversation on 1/8/2014. I reiterated that I spoke with Sofia last week and stated that she is very happy, well adjusted, and enjoying her time with them."
3556107,HM and HD say that things are going really well thus far.
3556106,"HM has to change arrival meeting to tomorrow since her aunt is in hospital. AP is doing great. Pro-active, engages children, funny and nice."
3556104,AP has to return home early because of a family emergency with her sister who has cancer and special needs. AD will speak to both HF and AP to go over timeline. HF only needs an AP till end of July/August
3556103,AD spoke to HD and he says that everything is going really great and they are happy that Andrea is starting to take classes.
3556054,"HM and HD both say that they are concerned with the match so far. They say that AP is doing a great job with their younger daughter, but she and the 4 year old do not get along and they say it is because AP has a negative tone of voice with her most of the time and they say it seems as though AP dislikes her. They say that they know that they have probably contributed to the problem by not communicating with AP earlier as to how to communicate with her. They say that if AP makes just one simple change with how she approaches their daughter (tone) it should make all of the difference. HF says that the plan on speaking with AP tonight in a positive manner in hopes that they can come up with a team plan on what strategies may work with their daughter. They say that they really want this match to work and hope that AP feels the same after the meeting. AD offered to meet with all parties next week and let them know that AP wanted AD there, but AD was not available this week due to vacation plans. HF says that they don't feel like AD needs to be present. They say that they will let AD how the conversation goes with AP and if AD should meet with them when she returns."
3556047,Ellen was on her way home from a weekend in the mountains skiing with the kids when I called.  She says that things are great and Maria did not join them on this trip but stayed at home.
3556035,"Spoke with Hd and everything is good. Sad to see Ap go, they really enjoyed having her with them."
3556032,"good.  Had a little issue with things, emailed her and then they discussed and things are better now."
3556026,HM is having some problems with AP's work. HM feels that AP is on her phone too much and isn't interacting with HC has much as she should be.
3556020,They are doing great.  I went to her daughter's birthday party and brought my daughter.  She said another HF wanted info about an AP because Saori is so great so I talked to them.
3556018,"Great!  laura is very happy.  She doessome small things, like she dried Laura's nice linen pants that she doesn't put in the dryer, but since everything else is good, this didn't bother her a bit.  She said she had gotten to the point with Kai that every single thing bothered her.  With Lauren she is so good at things, small things like not making her bed doen't make her upset.  She is good wth the kids, preparing meals and Laura is giving her freedom to spend with her boyfriend so she is happy too.  Discussed finance printout with her."
3556012,"Ok.  Nico had a car accident.  It wasn't her fault...someone rear-ended her at a stoplight.  Nico was very upset when she called on the weekend an I didn't get the mesage until today/Monday.  I didn't reach her when I called immediately after hearing it, so I called HM Haley.  Haley said she was sore, but she did go to the Dr but they didn't do much.  She thinks she found the insurance card.  Haley said Nico thought she had a concussion but Haley said the damage to the car was minimal, so she doubted she had a concussion.  She told her to take Advil, drink some fluids and put a heating pad on it.  Then her stomach hurt, but HM thinks she is ok.  AP texted later and said she will call me tomorrow."
3556011,"ver good. Monika went to San Deigo in HF car with a friend over Holiday's , it  went well. Discussed accident with AP and HF is feeling better about the driving. SHe is great with the kids"
3556009,"very well, Denise continues to do better and better. Would really like to extend with her."
3555974,Edith says that things are going well and that Aruana was looking forward to her class starting this week at CCCC.  We talked about how expensive the class is but she said she thought it was worth it.
3555967,Fine
3555966,Good
3555962,Great. HF is very happy with AP.
3555961,Good.
3555960,Good
3555956,Great.
3555954,HM doesn't find the AP to be useful to them.  AP was watching one of the two children today and forgot to feed him lunch.
3555948,Spoke with Stefan - things are great and Julia has a new friend in Cohasset from APIA - I told him that she can bring the new friend to the meetings if she likes.  They are all very happy!
3555943,Things going well - Marina was at a trade show in NY when I called.  We talked about the course that Cibele was interested in taking and the experience she would get coupled with the English language and I told her I thought it was a terrific course for her.
3555936,"HM reported that everything is going just fine.  She stated that they are getting sad about AP leaving, but that this is just part of the process."
3555935,"Good, coming to an end and HF is sad, but excited to welcome their new AP 2/18. Current AP will stay on a few days to help with the transition. AD will call HD at the beginning of Feb. to make an AP Orientation appt. for AP Bednarova. HD asked for soc. sec. office and tax info that I will be e-mailing to him. HD feels AP is getting antsy to leave since most of her friends have gone home."
3555934,Spoke with Ozell and things are going well - they have really enjoyed having Lety with them.  They are going to see if they need another au pair and will let me know as Lety is not going to extend.  Everyone is doing well.
3555933,Things are going well and Ligia has her ticket to go home.  Everyone is fine but busy with the kids.
3555932,"Fine, they are getting through the next few months until the placement is over. I asked how the Christmas trip went  after their argument and the HM stated that she felt that the AP was being passive/aggressive with regards to just helping out in general. I asked if the HM was referring to while the AP was on duty and she said, no, more like just in being part of the family. HM stated that ever her family commented on how the AP just sat back and watched the HM struggle occasionally with the HC's. HM felt that this was in reaction to AP wanting a schedule for her on/off times while on vacation and didn't intend to help HM out if she wasn't supposed to be working. HM said that she got the AP her own hotel room for the last 2 nights of the trip because she felt the AP needed a break."
3555923,Things are going well.  HM said that the AP is doing all of the things expected of her.  I reminded HM of the monthly meeting. She said that her daughter is in a production that day until 9pm but HM will see if she can get a ride home from someone.
3555920,Fantastic. HM feels that AP will be hard to replace!
3555915,Good. AP is great!!! Could not ask for anyone better.
3555914,Things are going great.  HM said the AP is showing some great decision making skills and that makes her and her husband very pleased with their new AP.
3555913,Everything I going well with current AP. HM is having some issues with next AP and her certification. HM is working with Corporate on that issue.
3555912,"Good. No questions, comments or concerns. All is good."
3555910,Things are going very well.  HM is so pleased with the transition.  Cora seems to really like Risa.
3555909,"Hm told me that all is well as usual. No changes or questions. HM mentioned that she has been in touch with Monica, their ap 2 years ago who would be interested in coming back as a repeat ap. I explained to HM that ap should contact her agency back home."
3555907,things are going well and they are in the throws of looking for another au pair but were surprised that the pool was so low on SA AP's.  She sent the matching expert an e-mail asking if it was a visa problem etc.
3555904,Spoke with Dave who had a few questions about the extension as he had spoken with Monika and was a little confused about the process as they did not know that Monika wanted to stay.  They will talk tonight and call me if they need any questions answered
3555903,Amy says Di is great. They are going to extend for 1 year. We reviewed all the extension information.
